00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.034
<v Palash Bharadwaj>But you know,
maybe a lot of people you guys know,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/26-1
00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:12.526
<v Palash Bharadwaj>but there's a lot of things which is also
new that you would probably see.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/26-2
00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:13.259
<v Palash Bharadwaj>So let me.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/35-0
00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.099
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Share my screen. Once you see my screen,
let me know. We will uh.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/38-0
00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.099
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Can you see my screen?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/39-0
00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.059
<v Mayurkumar Chaniyara>Yes.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/40-0
00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.819
Yes.

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/81-0
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.331
<v Palash Bharadwaj>OK, so basically again,
everyone knows about database. I mean,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/81-1
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:41.068
<v Palash Bharadwaj>I'm not doing something new,
but want to kind of get little bit,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/81-2
00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:47.118
<v Palash Bharadwaj>you know, on the side where as you know,
database has been always the backbone and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/81-3
00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:51.419
<v Palash Bharadwaj>is going to remain the backbone of any
modern application.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/112-0
00:00:51.659 --> 00:01:00.991
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Application whether we are looking at in
terms of directly impacting scalability</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/112-1
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:09.979
<v Palash Bharadwaj>and what actually Ashish did help was
that part on certain things, right? So.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/146-0
00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:15.415
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Having the right database choice can make
or break the architecture based on the</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/146-1
00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:19.552
<v Palash Bharadwaj>changes that you're seeing,
you know as we move forward, right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/146-2
00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:24.659
<v Palash Bharadwaj>And choosing it could help in terms of
scalability, which impacts scalability.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/149-0
00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:27.459
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Compliance and erformance all.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/191-0
00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Palash Bharadwaj>So the first one that we're talking about
the SQL relational database,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/191-1
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.307
<v Palash Bharadwaj>which is the foundation, right?
We have done that and which basically</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/191-2
00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:43.219
<v Palash Bharadwaj>stores database in rows and columns as we
all know.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/233-0
00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.508
<v Palash Bharadwaj>It ensures the consistency with ACID
compliance.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/233-1
00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:53.871
<v Palash Bharadwaj>What it means is basically all the ACID
transactions are atomicity, consistency,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/233-2
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:59.685
<v Palash Bharadwaj>isolation and durability, right?
And it guarantees the data integrity for</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/233-3
00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:03.299
<v Palash Bharadwaj>any mission critical applications that we
do.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/285-0
00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.941
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Of course security is pretty strong
because got RBAC which is role based</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/285-1
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.704
<v Palash Bharadwaj>access control,
encryption and audit trails, right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/285-2
00:02:12.704 --> 00:02:17.915
<v Palash Bharadwaj>And of course foreign keys and
constraints ensures the data consistency</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/285-3
00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:22.619
<v Palash Bharadwaj>which is the referential integrity for
across the tables, right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/333-0
00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:27.306
<v Palash Bharadwaj>This is very, very important.
Now if you look at from the examples of</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/333-1
00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:30.313
<v Palash Bharadwaj>the use cases, banking systems,
if you look at it,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/333-2
00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:33.733
<v Palash Bharadwaj>they are very heavily on this because
it's transactional,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/333-3
00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:36.445
<v Palash Bharadwaj>transaction safety and regulatory
compliance.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/333-4
00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:39.099
<v Palash Bharadwaj>They maintain healthcare for patient
record.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/369-0
00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:49.621
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Integrity and HIPAA compliance and ERP
complex business logics. So as you know,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/369-1
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:56.024
<v Palash Bharadwaj>MySQL, Postgres, SQL, Oracle, SQL Server,
you know other gold standard of</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/369-2
00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:59.659
<v Palash Bharadwaj>structured transactional workloads, right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/370-0
00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:00.899
<v Palash Bharadwaj>OK.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/402-0
00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.752
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Now the next one also we have used No SQL
Revolution,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/402-1
00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:12.410
<v Palash Bharadwaj>which is again a document database,
document database that we call.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/402-2
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.819
<v Palash Bharadwaj>It is designed for scalability and
feasibility basically, right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/430-0
00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:26.952
<v Palash Bharadwaj>And it is schema less or you call it
schema light model horizontal scaling</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/430-1
00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:33.705
<v Palash Bharadwaj>across the clusters.
It's ideal for large scale real time</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/430-2
00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:35.219
<v Palash Bharadwaj>applications.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/465-0
00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.644
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Right.
If you look at social media applications</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/465-1
00:03:39.644 --> 00:03:45.664
<v Palash Bharadwaj>needing, you know, rapid growth,
no SQL would be the ideal choice, right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/465-2
00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:52.255
<v Palash Bharadwaj>e-commerce cataloging and all the stuff
also comes in Mongo DB and Dynamo Dynamo</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/465-3
00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:52.499
<v Palash Bharadwaj>DB.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/475-0
00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:57.087
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Excel, you know they are.
They create those product hierarchy and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/475-1
00:03:57.087 --> 00:03:58.979
<v Palash Bharadwaj>all the stuff, right? So that helps.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/515-0
00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.942
<v Palash Bharadwaj>The next slide and again I'm going a
little fast because I have another</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/515-1
00:04:04.942 --> 00:04:08.745
<v Palash Bharadwaj>meeting coming up.
So I want to make sure that I go through</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/515-2
00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:12.928
<v Palash Bharadwaj>all the slides quickly.
High performance data storage which has a</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/515-3
00:04:12.928 --> 00:04:17.619
<v Palash Bharadwaj>key value stores and the columnar
database right the two different kinds.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/534-0
00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:27.054
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Oops, did it? Sharing stopped.
I don't know why it happened</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/527-0
00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:23.939
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah, this screen should stop. Yeah.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/534-1
00:04:27.054 --> 00:04:31.579
<v Palash Bharadwaj>automatically. OK, OK, can you see?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/538-0
00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.859
<v Shivkumar C>Yes.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/569-0
00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.510
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Let me know once, OK,
high performance data storage,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/569-1
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.794
<v Palash Bharadwaj>a columnar database.
Now what it you know if you look at from</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/569-2
00:04:45.794 --> 00:04:52.179
<v Palash Bharadwaj>the high value storage point of you know
view what it does is.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/599-0
00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.781
<v Palash Bharadwaj>It has lightning fast reads,
so if you look at sub millisecond</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/599-1
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Palash Bharadwaj>response times like radius is ideal for
session in a management or real time</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/599-2
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.459
<v Palash Bharadwaj>caching IoT ingestion.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/655-0
00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:13.792
<v Palash Bharadwaj>That can handle millions of sensor writes
per second because that's real-time data</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/655-1
00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:18.905
<v Palash Bharadwaj>which will position across the clusters.
On the columnar database side,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/655-2
00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:24.088
<v Palash Bharadwaj>you'll have the analytics optimization
where the column wise storage and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/655-3
00:05:24.088 --> 00:05:26.219
<v Palash Bharadwaj>compression delivers a faster.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/695-0
00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:32.771
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Analytical queries and real time insights
like Cassandra or Hbase will have massive</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/695-1
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Palash Bharadwaj>data set and the customer behavior
tracking with the business intelligence</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/695-2
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.555
<v Palash Bharadwaj>comes handy with that.
If you look at from high performance and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/695-3
00:05:42.555 --> 00:05:46.779
<v Palash Bharadwaj>compress compression and indexing,
this would be very very.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/698-0
00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:48.099
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Valuable.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/734-0
00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.425
<v Palash Bharadwaj>OK,
now I'm talking about the specialized</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/734-1
00:05:54.425 --> 00:06:00.502
<v Palash Bharadwaj>database architecture.
What are those data? One is the graph DB.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/734-2
00:06:00.502 --> 00:06:04.897
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Again,
you know probably of are aware Neo4j or</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/734-3
00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.019
<v Palash Bharadwaj>AWS Neptune.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/767-0
00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:12.099
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Because they are,
they are good at the relationship heavy</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/767-1
00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:17.447
<v Palash Bharadwaj>data where you can look at fraud
detection algorithms,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/767-2
00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:23.379
<v Palash Bharadwaj>you can focus on great deep insights in
terms of traversals.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/801-0
00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:28.242
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Or you're looking at in terms of
recommendations,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/801-1
00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:34.546
<v Palash Bharadwaj>influence and all the stuff.
Graph database would be a great database</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/801-2
00:06:34.546 --> 00:06:39.139
<v Palash Bharadwaj>time series database like Influx DB or
Prometheus.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/828-0
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:50.157
<v Palash Bharadwaj>It optimize for the timestamp data.
It stores the metrics right and events</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/828-1
00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:57.939
<v Palash Bharadwaj>efficiently as well as use.
It is very useful for monitoring the IoT.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/846-0
00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:01.758
<v Palash Bharadwaj>We were just talking about IoT systems,
right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/846-1
00:07:01.758 --> 00:07:05.209
<v Palash Bharadwaj>So server performance and monitoring
becomes very,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/846-2
00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:09.539
<v Palash Bharadwaj>very handy with this high frequency
writing and all this stuff.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/872-0
00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:19.560
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Now there are a couple of things that are
emerging now in the database site.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/872-1
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.179
<v Palash Bharadwaj>One is the object oriented database,
Object DB or Zo DB.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/906-0
00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:33.943
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Which basically what it does is is great
for simulations, engineering,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/906-1
00:07:33.943 --> 00:07:40.099
<v Palash Bharadwaj>CAD services, you know,
very important spatial database like</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/906-2
00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.539
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Oracle Spatial or Post GIS.
It is more for.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/937-0
00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:52.728
<v Palash Bharadwaj>GIS and logistics, mapping applications,
logistics, optimization and planning.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/937-1
00:07:52.728 --> 00:08:00.099
<v Palash Bharadwaj>And then the last one actually has a new
SQL revolution, which is on the.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/966-0
00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:09.997
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Cockroach DB and Volt DB which combines
the acid guarantees and with horizontal</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/966-1
00:08:09.997 --> 00:08:16.419
<v Palash Bharadwaj>scalability ideal for global SAS
platforms and it powers.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/981-0
00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:21.708
<v Palash Bharadwaj>The you know,
if you look at for SAS applications,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/981-1
00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:25.699
<v Palash Bharadwaj>it's you know,
consistent and it can scale massively.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1018-0
00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:36.479
<v Palash Bharadwaj>I kind of created a matrix here based on
the primary use cases and weakness like</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1018-1
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:44.979
<v Palash Bharadwaj>SQL and relation database type could be
mature for tooling but again limited on.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1059-0
00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:52.401
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Horizontal scaling, so ERP, finance,
healthcare could be one and document no</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1059-1
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:57.088
<v Palash Bharadwaj>SQL could be, you know,
schema flexible and limited asset</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1059-2
00:08:57.088 --> 00:09:01.451
<v Palash Bharadwaj>transactions,
so it's good for CMS or e-commerce kind</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1059-3
00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:02.179
<v Palash Bharadwaj>of thing.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1093-0
00:09:02.619 --> 00:09:10.156
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Key value no SQL again, high performance,
simplicity, limited querying capability,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1093-1
00:09:10.156 --> 00:09:17.058
<v Palash Bharadwaj>so caching session management could be
one of the graph no SQL relationship</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1093-2
00:09:17.058 --> 00:09:19.419
<v Palash Bharadwaj>insights traversal it can.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1122-0
00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:24.650
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Complex query you know,
optimizations like fraud detection,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1122-1
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:30.544
<v Palash Bharadwaj>social media and you know networks and
all the stuff. New SQL is again,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1122-2
00:09:30.544 --> 00:09:35.619
<v Palash Bharadwaj>it's the strength is basically asset plus
horizontal scaling.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1154-0
00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:42.296
<v Palash Bharadwaj>And technology still is maturing,
so global says high traffic systems if</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1154-1
00:09:42.296 --> 00:09:46.151
<v Palash Bharadwaj>you choose,
if we choose the right workload</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1154-2
00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:51.059
<v Palash Bharadwaj>characteristics,
not just on the technology preference.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1192-0
00:09:51.739 --> 00:09:56.079
<v Palash Bharadwaj>I think that's the right way to make a
decision.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1192-1
00:09:56.079 --> 00:10:01.747
<v Palash Bharadwaj>If you look at from the architectural
consideration part of it,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1192-2
00:10:01.747 --> 00:10:06.884
<v Palash Bharadwaj>you would look at what are the
overlapping pieces, right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1192-3
00:10:06.884 --> 00:10:11.579
<v Palash Bharadwaj>So certain things are partition tolerant
consistent.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1223-0
00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:18.001
<v Palash Bharadwaj>And available, available partition.
So you need to look at how the</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1223-1
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Palash Bharadwaj>consistency,
availability and partition tolerance kind</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1223-2
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:30.099
<v Palash Bharadwaj>of overlaps with each other and which one
to use at what point of time.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1224-0
00:10:30.939 --> 00:10:31.339
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Um.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1260-0
00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:40.042
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Hybrid architecture.
This is the modern approach that anybody</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1260-1
00:10:40.042 --> 00:10:45.041
<v Palash Bharadwaj>is looking at.
If you look at from the leading, you know,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1260-2
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:50.902
<v Palash Bharadwaj>organizations, they, you know,
adopt polyglot persistent strategies</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1260-3
00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:51.419
<v Palash Bharadwaj>which.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1306-0
00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:58.448
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Selects the optimal database for specific
user use cases rather than you know just</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1306-1
00:10:58.448 --> 00:11:03.132
<v Palash Bharadwaj>going into a single solution.
So it's kind of a mixed hybrid.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1306-2
00:11:03.132 --> 00:11:07.513
<v Palash Bharadwaj>We would look at the transactional core
analytical layer,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1306-3
00:11:07.513 --> 00:11:11.819
<v Palash Bharadwaj>caching strategy and search and discovery.
So all those.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1312-0
00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:18.299
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Would kind of bring your modern approach
of making it more.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1342-0
00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:26.765
<v Palash Bharadwaj>You know best way to look at from the
architecture standpoint, what would be,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1342-1
00:11:26.765 --> 00:11:30.935
<v Palash Bharadwaj>you know,
database selection strategy in terms of</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1342-2
00:11:30.935 --> 00:11:34.939
<v Palash Bharadwaj>recommendation and next steps you should
audit.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1393-0
00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:40.999
<v Palash Bharadwaj>The current architecture identify the
performance bottleneck scalability with</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1393-1
00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:45.395
<v Palash Bharadwaj>the existing database infrastructure,
run proof of concepts,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1393-2
00:11:45.395 --> 00:11:49.070
<v Palash Bharadwaj>define hybrid strategy,
establish that governance,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1393-3
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:54.330
<v Palash Bharadwaj>and then recommend the approach.
I think that's where the recommendation</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1393-4
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:54.979
<v Palash Bharadwaj>comes in.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1416-0
00:11:55.139 --> 00:12:01.601
<v Palash Bharadwaj>And that's where the future belongs,
where people can strategically combine</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1416-1
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:07.979
<v Palash Bharadwaj>database technologies and rather than
just bidding on one single solution.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1415-0
00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:08.299
<v Mujaffarkhan Sanadi>Mm.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1421-0
00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:10.819
<v Amit Hiremath>Amazing.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1446-0
00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:13.501
<v Palash Bharadwaj>So that's, you know,
and I'll share the slides,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1446-1
00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:18.444
<v Palash Bharadwaj>but I just thought to share quickly this
because nobody was ready and this was</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1446-2
00:12:18.444 --> 00:12:21.259
<v Palash Bharadwaj>ready with me.
So I just thought I'll share.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1473-0
00:12:21.819 --> 00:12:26.205
<v Amit Hiremath>Thank you. Thank you, Palash.
I think that's quite helpful.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1473-1
00:12:26.205 --> 00:12:30.737
<v Amit Hiremath>A very summarized one,
but quite neat and very something that</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1473-2
00:12:30.737 --> 00:12:36.659
<v Amit Hiremath>could be used in actual practical ways
when you're designing a system basically.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1466-0
00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:35.219
<v Palash Bharadwaj>That's.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1469-0
00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:36.779
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Correct.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1489-0
00:12:36.739 --> 00:12:39.462
<v Amit Hiremath>Vijay,
maybe you can look at it when we're</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1489-1
00:12:39.462 --> 00:12:43.072
<v Amit Hiremath>designing this,
you know Aramco systems and all it would</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1489-2
00:12:43.072 --> 00:12:45.099
<v Amit Hiremath>be useful to analyze and select.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1487-0
00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:43.699
<v Shivkumar C>Yeah.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1490-0
00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:48.259
<v Vijay Nadar>Yeah, yeah, sure.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1501-0
00:12:48.859 --> 00:12:50.739
<v Amit Hiremath>OK, cool.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1558-0
00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:52.590
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>Thank you Palash.
I think you're lots of new things here,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1502-0
00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:50.859
<v Vijay Nadar>Yeah.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1558-1
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:57.044
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>especially the logistic you mentioned
couple of things CAD, CAM, the new.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1518-0
00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:56.219
<v Vijay Nadar>Mhm.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1558-2
00:12:57.044 --> 00:13:01.559
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>I think that is very important to
understand which database suits based on</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1558-3
00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:05.231
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>your architecture.
It is correct statement make or break and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1545-0
00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:05.299
<v Vijay Nadar>Mm.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1558-4
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.579
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>that I have seen in my last experience.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1547-0
00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:05.619
<v Amit Hiremath>Thanks.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1552-0
00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:07.139
<v Aashish Sonawane>Oh.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1603-0
00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:13.505
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>So we spend like for first data client,
right? You might heard.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1603-1
00:13:13.505 --> 00:13:17.928

<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>They said DB2 will not fit due to X for

<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah, yeah, it's the same thing. Hey,

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1912-0
00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:55.099
<v Mayurkumar Chaniyara>That inbox open, yeah.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1959-0
00:15:54.419 --> 00:16:00.144
<v Amit Hiremath>Only for architects we are creating new
because there's something called as a 5 +</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1959-1
00:16:00.144 --> 00:16:04.752
<v Amit Hiremath>5 which is based on the scaling of
framework. So I get my 5 to 5.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1932-0
00:16:04.099 --> 00:16:04.619
<v Mayurkumar Chaniyara>Mhm.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1959-2
00:16:04.752 --> 00:16:09.779
<v Amit Hiremath>Similarly we use five to five.
So because everybody's there I think and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1959-3
00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:13.619
<v Amit Hiremath>I felt this could be useful for you to
understand how.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2001-0
00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:17.600
<v Amit Hiremath>Things work, you know,
as a technology office, new practices,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1960-0
00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:17.219
<v Mayurkumar Chaniyara>Oh.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2001-1
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.359
<v Amit Hiremath>what happens.
So what I'll do is I did share this</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2001-2
00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:24.443
<v Amit Hiremath>yesterday with I think Kishore, right.
I think Kishore I shared with you.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2001-3
00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:27.367
<v Amit Hiremath>But like, yeah,
I've shared this with the architect.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1985-0
00:16:24.579 --> 00:16:25.619
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>Yeah, I am.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/1989-0
00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:27.539
<v Kishor Gwala>M.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2001-4
00:16:27.367 --> 00:16:29.299
<v Amit Hiremath>I'll just share with everyone here.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2008-0
00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:34.259
<v Amit Hiremath>So that they get an idea about how things
work. OK, so I'll share my window.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2033-0
00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:40.506
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>But Amit, we have not done with 5 + 5,
I think we have done the normal under,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2045-0
00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:43.697
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah, I know. I think for you, yeah,
for you, because you are,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2033-1
00:16:40.506 --> 00:16:40.779
<v Yusuf Kumarkiri>yeah.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2045-1
00:16:43.697 --> 00:16:46.979
<v Amit Hiremath>I know completely on Nazam, it may be OK,
but.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2097-0
00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:51.433
<v Amit Hiremath>But you can also have a look at it.
I know it.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2097-1
00:16:51.433 --> 00:16:54.598
<v Amit Hiremath>It helps you to also align yourself to,
you know,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2097-2
00:16:54.598 --> 00:16:58.522
<v Amit Hiremath>what we're doing in the technology
function basically, right.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2097-3
00:16:58.522 --> 00:17:03.648
<v Amit Hiremath>So now in technology there are what we
call as 5 + 5. So there are 5 priorities,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2097-4
00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:07.699
<v Amit Hiremath>which is basically what we call as
projects basically and five.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2145-0
00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:11.796
<v Amit Hiremath>Metrics that we track.
Now that doesn't mean that we only do</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2145-1
00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:15.423
<v Amit Hiremath>those five.
These are the things that are tracked and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2145-2
00:17:15.423 --> 00:17:19.588
<v Amit Hiremath>reported every week,
every month to the leadership and across</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2145-3
00:17:19.588 --> 00:17:23.686
<v Amit Hiremath>all the functions, right? We do like,
I do like 2025 things,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2145-4
00:17:23.686 --> 00:17:27.179
<v Amit Hiremath>but out of that only five are very
important where?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2196-0
00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:32.970
<v Amit Hiremath>It is completely focused on organization
success or the organization road map. OK,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2196-1
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.290
<v Amit Hiremath>so there are priorities.
So first priority is again this is coming</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2196-2
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.384
<v Amit Hiremath>from both tech and new practices.
So just help.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2196-3
00:17:40.384 --> 00:17:44.769
<v Amit Hiremath>So if you see I mentioned this priorities
belongs to new practices.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2196-4
00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:47.219
<v Amit Hiremath>It's about growth of Python practices.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2237-0
00:17:47.219 --> 00:17:52.309
<v Amit Hiremath>Is using paid campaigns.
So we're doing some Google paid campaigns</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2237-1
00:17:52.309 --> 00:17:58.158
<v Amit Hiremath>where we have to assist and help the
there is a agency that we are hiring to</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2237-2
00:17:58.158 --> 00:18:03.476
<v Amit Hiremath>help them with the content to finalize
the audience, target audience,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2237-3
00:18:03.476 --> 00:18:06.819
<v Amit Hiremath>the ad copies, the keywords,
the different.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2283-0
00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:13.375
<v Amit Hiremath>Content and there are also geographical,
you know locations that you need to.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2283-1
00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:19.853
<v Amit Hiremath>There are a lot of things that you do
that is that is one of the priorities for</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2283-2
00:18:19.853 --> 00:18:23.416
<v Amit Hiremath>me.
Then the tech priority too is pre sales</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2283-3
00:18:23.416 --> 00:18:26.979
<v Amit Hiremath>as pre sales X as we call it.
So there are.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2320-0
00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:31.722
<v Amit Hiremath>There are some 27 pipeline we were to
close 14 out of them and there is a pre</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2320-1
00:18:31.722 --> 00:18:36.647
<v Amit Hiremath>sales CSAT that happens to the pre sales
team that has to move from 4.25 to 4.5.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2320-2
00:18:36.647 --> 00:18:41.268
<v Amit Hiremath>So that was the target that was taken.
So that was this is the technology's</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2320-3
00:18:41.268 --> 00:18:42.059
<v Amit Hiremath>priority too.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2378-0
00:18:42.179 --> 00:18:46.181
<v Amit Hiremath>Then then the new practices priority 3
where we are working on Saudi cloud</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2378-1
00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:49.704
<v Amit Hiremath>strategy and door openers where we have
identified the use cases,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2378-2
00:18:49.704 --> 00:18:53.707
<v Amit Hiremath>we have to provide the content.
So we did one of the SharePoint migration,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2378-3
00:18:53.707 --> 00:18:57.122
<v Amit Hiremath>then there's Ms. Fabric,
then there's a cyber security you know</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2378-4
00:18:57.122 --> 00:18:59.684
<v Amit Hiremath>content.
So that all is provided purpose we are</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2378-5
00:18:59.684 --> 00:19:01.659
<v Amit Hiremath>working with cloud partnerships like.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2419-0
00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:06.977
<v Amit Hiremath>Like with Azure, AWS, Google,
there's a second tier data provider cloud</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2419-1
00:19:06.977 --> 00:19:12.320
<v Amit Hiremath>protocol as V2 and we are working even
partnership with Outsystems, Odoo.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2419-2
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.023
<v Amit Hiremath>So all that comes under this and the
target is to provide all the use cases or</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2419-3
00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:19.179
<v Amit Hiremath>provide content.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2464-0
00:19:19.459 --> 00:19:23.292
<v Amit Hiremath>Then the 4th priority is a JPP practice,
Java, Python,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2464-1
00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:27.684
<v Amit Hiremath>Power BI and how do we grow that from 6
to 10 and achieve a 4.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2464-2
00:19:27.684 --> 00:19:33.190
<v Amit Hiremath>5 plus rating from all the customers.
This is more Palash is driving that this</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2464-3
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.979
<v Amit Hiremath>as a lead or a head of the practice but.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2515-0
00:19:36.419 --> 00:19:40.135
<v Amit Hiremath>This is one of the priorities and make
sure that this happens.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2515-1
00:19:40.135 --> 00:19:43.321
<v Amit Hiremath>Then the priority 5 is growth of
potential customers.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2515-2
00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:47.391
<v Amit Hiremath>So we've chosen 5 like if you see the
customers, here's SMS, Aramco,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2515-3
00:19:47.391 --> 00:19:51.580
<v Amit Hiremath>then there is Officer Track,
Excel Queue and there's vector solutions,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2515-4
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.179
<v Amit Hiremath>all of these we want them to kind of grow
to the next level.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2561-0
00:19:55.939 --> 00:20:00.031
<v Amit Hiremath>So that is the five priority.
So this is a combination of tech and new</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2561-1
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:04.641
<v Amit Hiremath>practices. Now that is just a priority.
So these are the things that we have to</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2561-2
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:09.310
<v Amit Hiremath>report and make sure that it's tracked.
The other is the metrics that means very</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2561-3
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.364
<v Amit Hiremath>the specific level targets and numbers
that we take.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2561-4
00:20:12.364 --> 00:20:15.419
<v Amit Hiremath>So there are 5 metrics that I've taken so
pre sales.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2608-0
00:20:15.459 --> 00:20:19.164
<v Amit Hiremath>Sales X is 1 A.
growth of strategic customers focused</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2608-1
00:20:19.164 --> 00:20:23.898
<v Amit Hiremath>best practice improvement,
POC based business growth and GPB growth,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2608-2
00:20:23.898 --> 00:20:27.123
<v Amit Hiremath>right.
And in that like in presales X closures</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2608-3
00:20:27.123 --> 00:20:32.819
<v Amit Hiremath>and sales is that is the you know target
15 out of 27 and five is the target CSAT.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2646-0
00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:37.802
<v Amit Hiremath>And this is gets tracked as you see on A.
weekly basis till the end and then growth</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2646-1
00:20:37.802 --> 00:20:41.538
<v Amit Hiremath>of strategic customers,
these are the five ones, officer track,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2646-2
00:20:41.538 --> 00:20:44.632
<v Amit Hiremath>excel queue.
So we are going good as of now in terms</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2646-3
00:20:44.632 --> 00:20:48.835
<v Amit Hiremath>of these officer track, excel,
the other three are kind of still to get</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2646-4
00:20:48.835 --> 00:20:49.419
<v Amit Hiremath>initiated.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2700-0
00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:54.262
<v Amit Hiremath>Focus best practices there.
We are working on 10 projects this time</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2700-1
00:20:54.262 --> 00:20:58.944
<v Amit Hiremath>and we're looking at all the best
practices like it starts from agile,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2700-2
00:20:58.944 --> 00:21:04.417
<v Amit Hiremath>sonar cube, CICD, usability, unit testing,
architectural best practices checklist.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2700-3
00:21:04.417 --> 00:21:09.099
<v Amit Hiremath>So all that is tracked here to 100%
achievement for these 10 projects.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2739-0
00:21:09.379 --> 00:21:12.723
<v Amit Hiremath>Projects and when you say 100%,
there is A. target that is taken.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2739-1
00:21:12.723 --> 00:21:16.725
<v Amit Hiremath>So not every project will get 5 ratings.
So now you maybe some of them were at</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2739-2
00:21:16.725 --> 00:21:19.816
<v Amit Hiremath>3:00. So we take A.
target that in 1/4 will reach to four at</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2739-3
00:21:19.816 --> 00:21:22.451
<v Amit Hiremath>an overall level,
but whatever is the target taken,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2739-4
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:24.579
<v Amit Hiremath>they have to achieve it. So that's how we.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2803-0
00:21:24.699 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Amit Hiremath>Take the target as 100% then POCS.
We worked on five POCS.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2803-1
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.076
<v Amit Hiremath>We worked with Nazam. There are two POCS.
One was an audit management tool,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2803-2
00:21:33.076 --> 00:21:35.930
<v Amit Hiremath>the second was RPA using automation
anywhere.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2803-3
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.281
<v Amit Hiremath>Then there was Omega Care where we did A.
POC for Ms.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2803-4
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:44.059
<v Amit Hiremath>Fabric which is successful with Microsoft
funding then Crystal Vision Azure.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2851-0
00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:47.757
<v Amit Hiremath>IoT POC.
Then the third one we are working on is</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2851-1
00:21:47.757 --> 00:21:53.011
<v Amit Hiremath>CVAS for Edge labs where we are trying to
help them convert the existing legacy</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2851-2
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:56.754
<v Amit Hiremath>application to A. more modern.
net Blazor kind of setup.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2851-3
00:21:56.754 --> 00:22:00.761
<v Amit Hiremath>So that's another POC.
So target is you have to implement 5,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2851-4
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:03.979
<v Amit Hiremath>present five and at least get one weed
billable.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2895-0
00:22:04.339 --> 00:22:07.014
<v Amit Hiremath>This is A.
these are good POC that means based on</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2895-1
00:22:07.014 --> 00:22:10.172
<v Amit Hiremath>the POC is the customer likes it and he
wants to continue.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2895-2
00:22:10.172 --> 00:22:14.079
<v Amit Hiremath>So now that's helping us right.
You know so Omega care is continuing and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2895-3
00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:16.808
<v Amit Hiremath>we've got one billable developer there
JPB growth.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2895-4
00:22:16.808 --> 00:22:19.859
<v Amit Hiremath>This is again how do we grow JPB practice
from 13 to 20.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2956-0
00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:25.873
<v Amit Hiremath>And then CSAT of course to achieve five.
So these are the things that we track.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2956-1
00:22:25.873 --> 00:22:31.008
<v Amit Hiremath>So this gives you an idea about what it
means by 5 + 5 and similarly so some of</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2956-2
00:22:31.008 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Amit Hiremath>this will overlap with some of the
architects that they will take up because</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2956-3
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.379
<v Amit Hiremath>like if you take an example SMS,
it's going to Vijay who's going to.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2985-0
00:22:40.499 --> 00:22:46.223
<v Amit Hiremath>Kind of need that architectural part and
supporting that Kishore would be working</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2970-0
00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:46.659
<v Shivkumar C>Architect.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2985-1
00:22:46.223 --> 00:22:49.923
<v Amit Hiremath>on unit testing architectural best
practices, right?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/2985-2
00:22:49.923 --> 00:22:55.299
<v Amit Hiremath>Then Ashish is working on again the CICD
part or even focus for that matter.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3023-0
00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:02.238
<v Amit Hiremath>Dilip is working on A. lot of AI things,
so or like crystal vision Dilip is</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3023-1
00:23:02.238 --> 00:23:05.472
<v Amit Hiremath>handling.
So then similarly it flows down to 5 + 5</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3023-2
00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:09.213
<v Amit Hiremath>for the architects.
So that's how the scaling up framework</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3023-3
00:23:09.213 --> 00:23:11.179
<v Amit Hiremath>works and what we have seen is.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3083-0
00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:14.875
<v Amit Hiremath>There are A.
lot of when because and the idea is when</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3083-1
00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:19.820
<v Amit Hiremath>we present this to the leadership and all
the functions every week and also on A.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3083-2
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.534
<v Amit Hiremath>monthly basis,
it increases the cooperation.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3083-3
00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:27.056
<v Amit Hiremath>I think we did discuss this in the CLC.
I think Tech leads were not there,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3083-4
00:23:27.056 --> 00:23:31.459
<v Amit Hiremath>but we've seen that the visibility of the
work that we all are doing at.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3087-0
00:23:31.459 --> 00:23:33.516
<v Amit Hiremath>Because the functions improves and
there's A.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3087-1
00:23:33.516 --> 00:23:35.619
<v Amit Hiremath>lot of collaboration and support that
happens.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3120-0
00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:41.561
<v Amit Hiremath>Right. So that's that's all, you know,
I just wanted to kind of let you know so</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3120-1
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:46.169
<v Amit Hiremath>that you know what's happening as A.
overall progress for whatever you're</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3120-2
00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:48.598
<v Amit Hiremath>doing,
how it actually culminates into</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3120-3
00:23:48.598 --> 00:23:52.459
<v Amit Hiremath>organizational metrices and how the
organization looks at it.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3141-0
00:23:52.659 --> 00:23:57.385
<v Amit Hiremath>Any any questions or any thoughts or any
recommendations from your side?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3141-1
00:23:57.385 --> 00:24:01.399
<v Amit Hiremath>You feel that? OK,
I think why not we look at this kind of A.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3141-2
00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:03.859
<v Amit Hiremath>metrics? Any any suggestions for that?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3182-0
00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:14.673
<v Vijay Nadar>One Amit,
just one thing right now Palash mentioned</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3148-0
00:24:12.499 --> 00:24:13.099
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3182-1
00:24:14.673 --> 00:24:19.628
<v Vijay Nadar>about the database time.
Can we have a means across all the</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3160-0
00:24:16.859 --> 00:24:17.099
<v Amit Hiremath>Hmm.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3182-2
00:24:19.628 --> 00:24:24.004
<v Vijay Nadar>project checks?
What are the existing data types and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3174-0
00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:24.299
<v Amit Hiremath>Right, very nice.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3182-3
00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:25.739
<v Vijay Nadar>propose any new data?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3240-0
00:24:25.699 --> 00:24:28.651
<v Amit Hiremath>Sure. So yeah,
I think it could be included as part of</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3240-1
00:24:28.651 --> 00:24:33.053
<v Amit Hiremath>our architecture best practices checklist.
So Kishore, maybe we can add it there.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3195-0
00:24:32.219 --> 00:24:32.419
<v Vijay Nadar>Yeah.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3202-0
00:24:32.939 --> 00:24:34.499
<v Kishor Gwala>Sure I'll.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3240-2
00:24:33.053 --> 00:24:36.757
<v Amit Hiremath>That was A. good point Vijay.
Though Vijay, just to kind of mention,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3240-3
00:24:36.757 --> 00:24:41.105
<v Amit Hiremath>there's one database performance related
checklist that we have which is created</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3240-4
00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:44.219
<v Amit Hiremath>by our database practice team,
Mayur Ambani and his team.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3236-0
00:24:42.859 --> 00:24:44.779
<v Vijay Nadar>OK, OK.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3275-0
00:24:44.499 --> 00:24:48.551
<v Amit Hiremath>And that we use for some of the we've not
taken it this quarter up,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3275-1
00:24:48.551 --> 00:24:53.259
<v Amit Hiremath>but that's something that we have we've I
think once we've done it for all the</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3275-2
00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:56.835
<v Amit Hiremath>projects across the board,
I think maybe two quarters back,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3262-0
00:24:56.219 --> 00:24:56.459
<v Vijay Nadar>OK.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3275-3
00:24:56.835 --> 00:25:01.007
<v Amit Hiremath>but maybe the architectural best
practices checklist can have another</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3275-4
00:25:01.007 --> 00:25:02.259
<v Amit Hiremath>point as A. database.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3326-0
00:25:03.699 --> 00:25:07.452
<v Amit Hiremath>And in fact, right, that's A.
very good point Vijay.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3283-0
00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:06.979
<v Vijay Nadar>Sure, I'll check that to check this. Yep.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3326-1
00:25:07.452 --> 00:25:13.048
<v Amit Hiremath>And in fact another thing just to mention
to you again, we can have questions,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3326-2
00:25:13.048 --> 00:25:18.643
<v Amit Hiremath>but because this happened yesterday,
our marketing team is trying to launch A.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3299-0
00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:14.659

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3326-3
00:25:18.643 --> 00:25:22.539
<v Amit Hiremath>campaign where they are using our 25
years completion.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3372-0

<v Amit Hiremath>for last 25 years whoever customers,
prospects or anybody in the industry has</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3372-3
00:25:36.464 --> 00:25:39.735
<v Amit Hiremath>connected with us on LinkedIn.

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3372-4
00:25:39.735 --> 00:25:42.539
<v Amit Hiremath>remarketing or retargeting campaign where.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3363-0
00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:42.379
<v Vijay Nadar>Mm.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3417-0
00:25:42.979 --> 00:25:46.468
<v Amit Hiremath>We are sending them that something about
25 years.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3417-1
00:25:46.468 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Amit Hiremath>So like one of the things that we
discussed is why could why not we do 25</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3417-2
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:57.003
<v Amit Hiremath>point checklist for architectural best
practices right for your 25 years so and</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3417-3
00:25:57.003 --> 00:26:02.339
<v Amit Hiremath>that we can do it free of cost we can do
A. 25 then I spoke about 25 pointer.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3406-0
00:25:59.699 --> 00:25:59.859
<v Vijay Nadar>Mm.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3491-0
00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:06.824
<v Amit Hiremath>Checklist for Dev SEC OPS like DSOM
Ashish. OK then then there is A.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3422-0
00:26:05.979 --> 00:26:06.019
<v Aashish Sonawane>Oh.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3491-1
00:26:06.824 --> 00:26:10.084
<v Amit Hiremath>cost optimization,
cloud cost optimization 25 pointer</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3426-0
00:26:07.219 --> 00:26:07.739
<v Vijay Nadar>Means.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3491-2
00:26:10.084 --> 00:26:12.921
<v Amit Hiremath>checklist.
So I think that's kind of how we're</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3491-3
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:16.000
<v Amit Hiremath>thinking.
So Kishore and maybe Ashish in the cloud</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3452-0
00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:15.979
<v Vijay Nadar>M.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3491-4
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.682
<v Amit Hiremath>practice we can take this up.
Kishore you can take it up key</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3491-5
00:26:19.682 --> 00:26:22.339
<v Amit Hiremath>architecture best practice may now we
have.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3472-0
00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:20.939
<v Kishor Gwala>Sure.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3553-0
00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:25.118
<v Amit Hiremath>I think we already have 25 points to home
game,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3499-0
00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:26.539
<v Kishor Gwala>We we have the category, yes.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3553-1
00:26:25.118 --> 00:26:29.615
<v Amit Hiremath>but why not use 25 pointers and keep that
ready? OK, same Ashish, this all maybe up.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3509-0
00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:30.219
<v Kishor Gwala>Noted.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3553-2
00:26:29.615 --> 00:26:33.583
<v Amit Hiremath>I think you have created A. new one.
This one I have seen and that's good.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3518-0
00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:32.619
<v Aashish Sonawane>Yeah.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3553-3
00:26:33.583 --> 00:26:36.704
<v Amit Hiremath>So you can convert that into 25 pointer,
just expand it A.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3553-4
00:26:36.704 --> 00:26:40.777
<v Amit Hiremath>bit and same with the cost optimization.
So we're thinking of launching that</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3553-5
00:26:40.777 --> 00:26:42.259
<v Amit Hiremath>campaign. We will go to all.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3603-0
00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:45.427
<v Amit Hiremath>The other connects that we have and we
say OK,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3603-1
00:26:45.427 --> 00:26:50.506
<v Amit Hiremath>we can do it for you free of cost like 25
pointer checklist for best best practices,</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3562-0
00:26:47.699 --> 00:26:47.819
<v Aashish Sonawane>OK.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3603-2
00:26:50.506 --> 00:26:55.346
<v Amit Hiremath>25 pointer checklist for cloud dev SEC
OPS and maturity and 25 pointers for cost</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3603-3
00:26:55.346 --> 00:26:58.752
<v Amit Hiremath>optimization.
So that's one thing that has come out now.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3603-4
00:26:58.752 --> 00:27:02.099
<v Amit Hiremath>So I mean because you mentioned Vijay
that came out so.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3605-0
00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:03.499
<v Amit Hiremath>Let's let's take that up.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3608-0
00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:05.659
<v Kishor Gwala>Sure, OK, maybe.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3609-0
00:27:03.939 --> 00:27:06.499
<v Aashish Sonawane>Yes, Amit.</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3623-0
00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:09.666
<v Amit Hiremath>OK. Apart from that,
any other questions on the the 5 + 5 or</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3623-1
00:27:09.666 --> 00:27:12.419
<v Amit Hiremath>how we're looking at our metrics?</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3672-0
00:27:13.219 --> 00:27:17.150
<v Aashish Sonawane>Yeah, Amit, the DevSecOps,
now we have tried to convert it into</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3672-1
00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:22.249
<v Aashish Sonawane>cloud automation and security checklist.
So title's different because we wanted to</v>

b08278d0-08bb-4e02-a219-e0718521863c/3641-0
