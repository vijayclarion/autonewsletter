00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.329
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK, let me share my screen.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/15-0
00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:15.969
<v Dilip Kachot>Yeah, it's visible.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/20-0
00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.243
<v Ajit Panaskar>Hey, good. Yeah, good morning everyone.
So to yeah,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/16-0
00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.169
Morning.

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/20-1
00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:25.501
<v Ajit Panaskar>today I'm going to just cover the various
monitoring tools and like we will compare</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/20-2
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:31.684
<v Ajit Panaskar>the tools along with the purpose and the
case study which we have taken for Nazam.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/20-3
00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:33.249
<v Ajit Panaskar>So we will go 1 by 1.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/21-0
00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.129
<v Ajit Panaskar>By one.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/23-0
00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.169
<v Ajit Panaskar>Am I audible?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/24-0
00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:36.729
<v Dilip Kachot>Yep.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/26-0
00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.169
<v Palash Bharadwaj>You are, yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/25-0
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.489
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/32-0
00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:43.804
<v Ajit Panaskar>Thanks. So Tim,
as you know that monitoring is very</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/32-1
00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:50.041
<v Ajit Panaskar>crucial when we are like working either
it's a be it a monolithic applications or</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/32-2
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:56.279
<v Ajit Panaskar>be it a cloud native applications which
involves micro services containerization.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/32-3
00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:59.169
<v Ajit Panaskar>So now what exactly is the monitoring?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/36-0
00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.837
<v Ajit Panaskar>And what is the difference between
monitoring and observability that we are</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/36-1
00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:07.864
<v Ajit Panaskar>going to like study today?
So first of all,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/36-2
00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:13.436
<v Ajit Panaskar>as you know that monitoring is important
and like first of all the monitoring is</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/36-3
00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:15.569
<v Ajit Panaskar>like the process of collecting.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/41-0
00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:20.053
<v Ajit Panaskar>Then analyzing,
then taking the insights from the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/41-1
00:01:20.053 --> 00:01:25.717
<v Ajit Panaskar>valuable informations which we have
received and then acting on it.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/41-2
00:01:25.717 --> 00:01:31.298
<v Ajit Panaskar>So basically this process of data
collection, then data analyzing,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/41-3
00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:35.129
<v Ajit Panaskar>data insights through visual
representations.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/46-0
00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.972
<v Ajit Panaskar>And dashboards and then taking the
preventive actions and the reactive</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/46-1
00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:42.886
<v Ajit Panaskar>actions also.
So that comes under the scope of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/46-2
00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:45.987
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitoring.
So what is the purpose of monitoring?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/46-3
00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:50.948
<v Ajit Panaskar>Now this monitoring will help you as I
mentioned that when you are dealing with</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/46-4
00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:55.289
<v Ajit Panaskar>the complex micro services architecture,
there are multiple services.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/52-0
00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.258
<v Ajit Panaskar>Interacting with each other and we don't
like because of the increased complexity</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/52-1
00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:05.783
<v Ajit Panaskar>of this communication.
So it is very hard to troubleshoot your</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/52-2
00:02:05.783 --> 00:02:09.446
<v Ajit Panaskar>application where exactly is the point of
failure.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/49-0
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.009
<v Amit Hiremath>Hold on.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/52-3
00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:14.689
<v Ajit Panaskar>So in such cases while like dealing with
this troubleshooting when beat.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/56-0
00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:21.286
<v Ajit Panaskar>Reported by our implementation team or be
it reported by the customer in the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/56-1
00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:26.461
<v Ajit Panaskar>production environment.
So that helps us you to troubleshoot your</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/56-2
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:31.009
<v Ajit Panaskar>issues or critical bugs.
So then you have to ensure that.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/61-0
00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.296
<v Ajit Panaskar>Like sometimes like we the customer
reports the cases like the CPU</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/61-1
00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:40.244
<v Ajit Panaskar>utilization is high or the high memory
consumption.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/61-2
00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:46.165
<v Ajit Panaskar>So we have to exact figure out why the
CPU utilization is going high or right</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/61-3
00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:50.569
<v Ajit Panaskar>when there is a spikes in the utilization.
So there also.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/65-0
00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:57.935
<v Ajit Panaskar>Comes the main like significance of
monitoring another like you can take like</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/65-1
00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:04.620
<v Ajit Panaskar>as I mentioned that you can take some
valuable inputs from the insights which</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/65-2
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.849
<v Ajit Panaskar>has come through the logs.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/70-0
00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.969
<v Ajit Panaskar>And the various metricses.
So these are the,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/70-1
00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.729
<v Ajit Panaskar>I will say the purpose and objective that
we need to go for monitoring.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/70-2
00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:23.129
<v Ajit Panaskar>So now the next like section is like what
are the different types of monitoring</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/70-3
00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.289
<v Ajit Panaskar>system which we can apply in the
production system.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/74-0
00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.764
<v Ajit Panaskar>So the first it can be infrastructure
monitor where you can monitor the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/74-1
00:03:32.764 --> 00:03:37.887
<v Ajit Panaskar>different servers, virtual machines,
containers when it comes with the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/74-2
00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:41.783
<v Ajit Panaskar>Kubernetes.
Then it can be an application level which</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/74-3
00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:46.689
<v Ajit Panaskar>is like APM. We can monitor network logs,
network monitor it comes.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/77-0
00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.913
<v Ajit Panaskar>Under network monitoring,
then security monitoring,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/77-1
00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:53.228
<v Ajit Panaskar>cloud monitoring.
So these basically these are the types</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/77-2
00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:55.089
<v Ajit Panaskar>and business process monitoring.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/82-0
00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.734
<v Ajit Panaskar>Now what are the different metricses
which we can track with the help of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/82-1
00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:04.786
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitoring?
So the first is like uptime and downtime.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/82-2
00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:09.137
<v Ajit Panaskar>So ideally the purpose of monitoring is
to make sure that it is whatever the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/82-3
00:04:09.137 --> 00:04:12.924
<v Ajit Panaskar>technical decisions or the technical
implementation you have made,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/82-4
00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:17.049
<v Ajit Panaskar>it should be in aligned with the business
objective. It should meet the.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/87-0
00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.408
<v Ajit Panaskar>Service level agreements, SLAS and SLUs,
so which covers like up time and downtime.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/87-1
00:04:22.408 --> 00:04:26.122
<v Ajit Panaskar>We have to ensure that the system is
always up time, right?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/87-2
00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:30.084
<v Ajit Panaskar>It is up and running.
So once you have that monitoring in place</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/87-3
00:04:30.084 --> 00:04:33.488
<v Ajit Panaskar>then you can,
I will say you can identify the services</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/87-4
00:04:33.488 --> 00:04:36.769
<v Ajit Panaskar>right which needs to be monitored.
You can have the.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/92-0
00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.034
<v Ajit Panaskar>Heartbeat or health check with and just
to ensure that the services are up and</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/92-1
00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:45.201
<v Ajit Panaskar>running.
So if in case any services goes down then</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/92-2
00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:49.796
<v Ajit Panaskar>it you should get some alert and
notification instead of it has an impact</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/92-3
00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:53.398
<v Ajit Panaskar>on the business.
So you just by ensuring the health check</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/92-4
00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:56.689
<v Ajit Panaskar>you are making that the services are up
and running.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/96-0
00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.306
<v Ajit Panaskar>So this comes under the uptime and the
downtime.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/96-1
00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:03.514
<v Ajit Panaskar>So you have to like again in the case of
now business,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/96-2
00:05:03.514 --> 00:05:07.829
<v Ajit Panaskar>right requirement or the business
objective is that the latency should be</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/96-3
00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:10.569
<v Ajit Panaskar>minimized,
the response time or the throughput</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/96-4
00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.969
<v Ajit Panaskar>should be very high, so.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/101-0
00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.348
<v Ajit Panaskar>Then next comes as mentioned in the
traditional approach that CPU and memory</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/101-1
00:05:18.348 --> 00:05:23.183
<v Ajit Panaskar>utilization that also like we can track
with the help of monitoring network</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/98-0
00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.289
<v Mujaffarkhan Sanadi>Mhm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/101-2
00:05:23.183 --> 00:05:28.400
<v Ajit Panaskar>throughput packet loss that again comes
under errors which you can track and logs</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/101-3
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.009
<v Ajit Panaskar>with the help of traces and the requests.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/104-0
00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:34.807
<v Ajit Panaskar>User experiences,
metrics and alerts and threshold.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/104-1
00:05:34.807 --> 00:05:38.329
<v Ajit Panaskar>So basically these are the metricses
which you can track.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/105-0
00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:43.529
<v Amit Hiremath>What is this app Dix score? App Dix score?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/110-0
00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.963
<v Ajit Panaskar>I think, yeah,
it comes under user experience metrics.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/110-1
00:05:47.963 --> 00:05:52.222
<v Ajit Panaskar>We have to check actually what what
exactly. Yeah, more into detail.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/110-2
00:05:52.222 --> 00:05:55.369
<v Ajit Panaskar>I will let you know about this.
Aptic score, yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/109-0
00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.209
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah, sure. Well, like honestly.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/116-0
00:05:53.249 --> 00:06:01.540
<v Palash Bharadwaj>But these are these are these are all
more towards the infra part of it major</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/116-1
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.729
<v Palash Bharadwaj>majority of them except right.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/112-0
00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:02.249
<v Ajit Panaskar>Mhm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/113-0
00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:02.449
<v Amit Hiremath>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/115-0
00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.249
<v Ajit Panaskar>Yes, yes, yes.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/119-0
00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:12.729
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Because application monitoring will have
a different way to look at.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/120-0
00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:13.689
<v Ajit Panaskar>Correct, correct, yes.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/128-0
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.097
<v Aashish Sonawane>So Appdex is application performance
index. I just googled it out.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/123-0
00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:22.609
<v Ajit Panaskar>Patient.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/128-1
00:06:21.097 --> 00:06:26.249
<v Aashish Sonawane>So it's related to application
application performance index.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/124-0
00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:23.409
<v Amit Hiremath>What is the application?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/126-0
00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:24.529
<v Dilip Kachot>Performance index.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/125-0
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.169
<v Ajit Panaskar>Performance index.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/129-0
00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:30.729
<v Amit Hiremath>Interesting.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/132-0
00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.889
<v Amit Hiremath>And it's part of user experience metrics,
huh?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/131-0
00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:33.849
<v Dilip Kachot>It's basically oh.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/133-0
00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.289
<v Aashish Sonawane>Uh.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/136-0
00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.093
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Yeah,
it's basically how much time it's taking</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/135-0
00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:38.249
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/136-1
00:06:39.093 --> 00:06:40.129
<v Palash Bharadwaj>and all this stuff.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/139-0
00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:43.329
<v Dilip Kachot>Response time.
Basically your response time.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/137-0
00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:40.889
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/140-0
00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:44.129
<v Palash Bharadwaj>Yep.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/143-0
00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:49.210
<v Ajit Panaskar>Maybe the load also, right?
Maybe how much time it is taking to load</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/143-1
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.569
<v Ajit Panaskar>the applications or the user interfaces
that may come? Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/146-0
00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:55.927
<v Dilip Kachot>So that's that's how the response time
and how how quickly user can see the you</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/146-1
00:06:55.927 --> 00:06:59.369
<v Dilip Kachot>know kind of performance of the
application.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/145-0
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:58.969
<v Ajit Panaskar>Yes, interact with the yes interface, yes.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/148-0
00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:04.171
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah, very interesting this thing.
Maybe we should include that as the next</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/148-1
00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:07.409
<v Amit Hiremath>thing in our architectural best practices
checks.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/150-0
00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:10.049
<v Amit Hiremath>It could be a good indicator.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/151-0
00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:11.889
<v Ajit Panaskar>6.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/156-0
00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:17.022
<v Dilip Kachot>So we have it Amit in our list.
We have this in a different areas like</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/156-1
00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:23.334
<v Dilip Kachot>for you know database query we have also
kind of a response time as a one of the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/153-0
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.649
<v Amit Hiremath>Hmm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/162-0
00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:25.066
<v Amit Hiremath>You got it. Yeah. Yeah, no, no,
I understand.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/156-2
00:07:23.334 --> 00:07:25.049
<v Dilip Kachot>checklist even in API.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/162-1
00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:29.112
<v Amit Hiremath>So what what I'm saying is abdex as such.
See, it's like, you know,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/162-2
00:07:29.112 --> 00:07:31.849
<v Amit Hiremath>if somebody has created a framework for
this,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/162-3
00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:34.527
<v Amit Hiremath>they must have thought through entire
thing.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/158-0
00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:34.529
<v Dilip Kachot>Uh, then yes.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/162-4
00:07:34.527 --> 00:07:37.562
<v Amit Hiremath>So we can just understand if there is a,
you know,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/162-5
00:07:37.562 --> 00:07:41.489
<v Amit Hiremath>defined metric to kind of measure this so
that we can include it.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/167-0
00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:45.399
<v Amit Hiremath>I know we we are doing,
I think performance is one of the thing</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/161-0
00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.289
<v Dilip Kachot>Yes, yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/167-1
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:50.186
<v Amit Hiremath>that we have of course you you're right.
I'm just checking if this is something</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/167-2
00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:55.033
<v Amit Hiremath>like you know we had that that whatever
well factor you know framework something</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/167-3
00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:56.409
<v Amit Hiremath>like that. So it helps.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/165-0
00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:55.769
<v Dilip Kachot>Hmm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/172-0
00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:00.961
<v Amit Hiremath>Because there's a lot of knowledge and
experience already has gone in creating</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/172-1
00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:03.379
<v Amit Hiremath>this.
So why to reinvent that wheel is what I</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/168-0
00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:01.729
<v Dilip Kachot>Exit.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/172-2
00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:05.849
<v Amit Hiremath>was thinking. Just check if it's useful.
Good.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/176-0
00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:08.888
<v Dilip Kachot>Certainly. So yeah,
right now it's more kind of in, you know,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/170-0
00:08:05.329 --> 00:08:06.089
<v Ajit Panaskar>Yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/176-1
00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.763
<v Dilip Kachot>numbers,
but probably in terms of metrics we can</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/176-2
00:08:11.763 --> 00:08:15.519
<v Dilip Kachot>change. So rather than having, you know,
30 seconds, 5 seconds,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/174-0
00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:13.649
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah, perfect.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/176-3
00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:18.219
<v Dilip Kachot>it could be between rating like zero to
five,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/176-4
00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:20.449
<v Dilip Kachot>what is the rating of the performance?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/180-0
00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:24.489
<v Amit Hiremath>Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Makes sense.
Thank you. Thank you, Ajit. OK, continue.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/177-0
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:21.329
<v Aashish Sonawane>Yeah, I.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/178-0
00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:21.809
<v Dilip Kachot>Got it.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/181-0
00:08:23.929 --> 00:08:24.849
<v Ajit Panaskar>Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/187-0
00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:29.542
<v Aashish Sonawane>Yeah, Amit, just one thing.
There is a formula to calculate this</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/184-0
00:08:29.049 --> 00:08:30.729
<v Amit Hiremath>OK, that's what I want to know.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/187-1
00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:34.209
<v Aashish Sonawane>aptic score as well.
I so we can have that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/186-0
00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.889
<v Amit Hiremath>So share that later maybe. Yeah. OK, cool.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/188-0
00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:37.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>Yeah, and uh, yes.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/190-0
00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:39.929
<v Amit Hiremath>Is Kishor not there today?
Is Kishor on leave or something?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/192-0
00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:44.209
<v Dilip Kachot>It seems to be offline.
I just checked and I don't get any.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/195-0
00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:50.089
<v Dilip Kachot>Notification from him that he's not going
to join. Hope things are good.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/194-0
00:08:48.849 --> 00:08:49.329
<v Amit Hiremath>OK, sure.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/196-0
00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:52.449
<v Amit Hiremath>OK, sure no worries.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/203-0
00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:56.480
<v Ajit Panaskar>Yeah.
And so team as we like we are heading so</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/203-1
00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.839
<v Ajit Panaskar>we can check like what are the different
monitoring tools available in the market</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/203-2
00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:07.001
<v Ajit Panaskar>and what criteria we can apply to select,
yeah, one of these monitoring tools.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/203-3
00:09:07.001 --> 00:09:11.510
<v Ajit Panaskar>So if we categorize those monitoring
tools, yeah, based on the type,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/203-4
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.209
<v Ajit Panaskar>so Nageos and comes under.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/208-0
00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:19.659
<v Ajit Panaskar>Monitoring for application performance
monitoring you can use Datadog,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/208-1
00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:25.402
<v Ajit Panaskar>App Dynamics, New Relic,
then Azure Monitor and AWS Cloudwatch.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/208-2
00:09:25.402 --> 00:09:32.849
<v Ajit Panaskar>Also for network you can use Solarwinds,
Wireshark, PRTG, Log Management, ELK and.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/212-0
00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:37.919
<v Ajit Panaskar>Stack then for cloud Azure and AWS is the
market leader.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/212-1
00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Ajit Panaskar>For security we can use Splunk IBM Qradar.
So now I I'm not sure whether like as a</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/212-2
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:50.588
<v Ajit Panaskar>like customer wise or the account wise
what different types of monitoring tools</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/212-3
00:09:50.588 --> 00:09:52.609
<v Ajit Panaskar>our like Clarion like has.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/217-0
00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:58.371
<v Ajit Panaskar>That expansion but what I have worked
upon earlier like Datadoc and the one</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/217-1
00:09:58.371 --> 00:10:02.982
<v Ajit Panaskar>which we are highlighted here in the
brown so new Datadoc AWS.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/217-2
00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:09.129
<v Ajit Panaskar>So these these are the paid and there is
rest ones are the open sources so be like.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/223-0
00:10:09.169 --> 00:10:14.208
<v Ajit Panaskar>Like I have used Datadog,
I have used Azure Cloud Azure monitoring</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/223-1
00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:19.999
<v Ajit Panaskar>and what I like found that Datadog is
very much like advanced visualization.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/223-2
00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:26.241
<v Ajit Panaskar>It has then it has like scalability also
and like it is very helpful in monitoring</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/223-3
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:27.369
<v Ajit Panaskar>your databases.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/229-0
00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:32.316
<v Ajit Panaskar>Queries like if you want to understand
like what queries are impacting the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/229-1
00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:36.470
<v Ajit Panaskar>performance of your application,
what stored it it goes like up to the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/229-2
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.623
<v Ajit Panaskar>very stored procedure level,
granular level where you can troubleshoot</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/229-3
00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:44.777
<v Ajit Panaskar>what part of the stored procedure is
causing the performance overhead.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/229-4
00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:47.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>So that is how that Datadog is very
helpful.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/233-0
00:10:47.409 --> 00:10:52.148
<v Ajit Panaskar>So you can monitor different services
infrastructure like as I mentioned</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/233-1
00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:56.953
<v Ajit Panaskar>databases with the help of Datadog.
So I was like I was extensively using</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/233-2
00:10:56.953 --> 00:11:00.784
<v Ajit Panaskar>this Datadog tool.
Then Azure Application Insights is also</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/233-3
00:11:00.784 --> 00:11:04.809
<v Ajit Panaskar>very much important while troubleshooting
the micro services.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/238-0
00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:09.387
<v Ajit Panaskar>An exact point of failure.
So these two are like like I have used to</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/238-1
00:11:09.387 --> 00:11:12.564
<v Ajit Panaskar>with it.
Apart from that I'm not sure like whether</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/238-2
00:11:12.564 --> 00:11:16.613
<v Ajit Panaskar>our like for monitoring our
infrastructure we generally use just</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/238-3
00:11:16.613 --> 00:11:19.416
<v Ajit Panaskar>Nagios.
So just we need like to check at the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/238-4
00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:24.649
<v Ajit Panaskar>Clarion side also what are the different
monitoring tools we are that are in place.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/243-0
00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:31.030
<v Ajit Panaskar>So that is what I yeah need to check then
like as I mentioned the what are the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/243-1
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:36.925
<v Ajit Panaskar>criterias like for selection of the tool.
So if you would like to have the high</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/243-2
00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:40.904
<v Ajit Panaskar>availability,
high scalability advanced vigilation go</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/243-3
00:11:40.904 --> 00:11:44.809
<v Ajit Panaskar>for Datadoc when like I think for Nazam
side we are.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/248-0
00:11:44.929 --> 00:11:49.415
<v Ajit Panaskar>We are using Prometheus CS,
Prometheus where it is open source and it</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/248-1
00:11:49.415 --> 00:11:54.221
<v Ajit Panaskar>is like integrated with the help of
Grafana to have the visualizations and</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/248-2
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:57.809
<v Ajit Panaskar>the dashboards.
So this the Prometheus and Grafana goes</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/248-3
00:11:57.809 --> 00:12:01.269
<v Ajit Panaskar>hand in hand.
Then Nagios is like open source and for</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/248-4
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.089
<v Ajit Panaskar>medium scalability and basic
visualization.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/252-0
00:12:04.529 --> 00:12:09.208
<v Ajit Panaskar>Zabbix is again open source,
high scalability, strong visualization.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/252-1
00:12:09.208 --> 00:12:13.006
<v Ajit Panaskar>New Relic is paid.
Generally it is used for application</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/252-2
00:12:13.006 --> 00:12:17.347
<v Ajit Panaskar>performance monitoring and advanced for
advanced visualization.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/252-3
00:12:17.347 --> 00:12:22.230
<v Ajit Panaskar>So that is the collection. OK,
that is the selection for the monitoring</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/260-0
00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah, and just to add,
I think we have PRTG,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/252-4
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.569
<v Ajit Panaskar>tool.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/260-1
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.369
<v Amit Hiremath>we have got Prometheus,
we have Wazoo is another one that has</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/254-0
00:12:26.729 --> 00:12:26.849
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/260-2
00:12:28.369 --> 00:12:33.320
<v Amit Hiremath>been installed now and Nagios is already
there in our premises basically.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/256-0
00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:31.609
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/260-3
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.674
<v Amit Hiremath>So if anyone really wants to try it out,
if you need any access to monitor your</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/257-0
00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:36.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>Mhm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/260-4
00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:39.209
<v Amit Hiremath>servers.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/261-0
00:12:40.689 --> 00:12:42.529
<v Amit Hiremath>You can ask ID team.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/262-0
00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:44.809
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK. That's good to know. Yes, Amit.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/263-0
00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:45.049
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/269-0
00:12:47.489 --> 00:12:50.914
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK, so now what?
What are the basic steps in the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/269-1
00:12:50.914 --> 00:12:54.968
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitoring processes?
As you know that we have to 1st the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/269-2
00:12:54.968 --> 00:13:00.699
<v Ajit Panaskar>collect the data using agents, then APIs.
You have to install those agents on the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/269-3
00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:05.312
<v Ajit Panaskar>virtual machines or on the Kubernetes
just to trace all the logs,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/269-4
00:13:05.312 --> 00:13:07.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>application logs. So once you.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/274-0
00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:13.580
<v Ajit Panaskar>To collect the data you should like like
now as I mentioned that when you are</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/274-1
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:19.983
<v Ajit Panaskar>dealing with the cloud native platforms,
you have different micro services in the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/274-2
00:13:19.983 --> 00:13:24.668
<v Ajit Panaskar>distributed platform.
So now all those logs specific to the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/274-3
00:13:24.668 --> 00:13:27.089
<v Ajit Panaskar>micro services, those are at a.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/279-0
00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:30.579
<v Ajit Panaskar>The virtual machine level or the
container level.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/279-1
00:13:30.579 --> 00:13:35.972
<v Ajit Panaskar>So you need to have a central mechanism
where you can collect all the logs from</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/279-2
00:13:35.972 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Ajit Panaskar>the different systems and it will be
placed at a central location so that</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/279-3
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.082
<v Ajit Panaskar>comes under the data aggregation.
So once you have collected and aggregated</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/279-4
00:13:46.082 --> 00:13:46.689
<v Ajit Panaskar>the data.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/283-0
00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:51.019
<v Ajit Panaskar>Data you have to then now take the
valuable insights, right?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/283-1
00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:56.733
<v Ajit Panaskar>So for getting that insights you have to
analyze the data and show it in the form</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/283-2
00:13:56.733 --> 00:14:02.377
<v Ajit Panaskar>of like dashboards and the visualizations
and once like as I mentioned that once</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/283-3
00:14:02.377 --> 00:14:06.209
<v Ajit Panaskar>let us say we have observed some like
deviations from.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/288-0
00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:10.640
<v Ajit Panaskar>What is expected?
So you can definitely keep the alerts in</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/288-1
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.243
<v Ajit Panaskar>place where you can,
for example if CPU utilization goes high,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/288-2
00:14:15.243 --> 00:14:20.869
<v Ajit Panaskar>so you should have that alert mechanism
to send that alert to the respective</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/288-3
00:14:20.869 --> 00:14:22.769
<v Ajit Panaskar>teams to take that action.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/287-0
00:14:23.169 --> 00:14:24.249
<v Mujaffarkhan Sanadi>Mm-hmm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/293-0
00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:30.063
<v Ajit Panaskar>Criteria for selecting this, this,
this criteria for selecting the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/293-1
00:14:30.063 --> 00:14:35.572
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitoring tool like as scalability then
up cost also is very important because</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/293-2
00:14:35.572 --> 00:14:40.943
<v Ajit Panaskar>some tools are very costly like Datadog
so that you have to check first while</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/293-3
00:14:40.943 --> 00:14:43.009
<v Ajit Panaskar>selecting the monitoring tool.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/298-0
00:14:43.409 --> 00:14:46.942
<v Ajit Panaskar>Then ease of integrations like what is
the capability,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/298-1
00:14:46.942 --> 00:14:49.833
<v Ajit Panaskar>visualization capability that tool
provides.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/298-2
00:14:49.833 --> 00:14:54.651
<v Ajit Panaskar>So basically these three 3-4 are the very
crucial like as I mentioned that</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/298-3
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:59.918
<v Ajit Panaskar>scalability then it should allow you to
extend your infrastructure right when you</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/298-4
00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:02.809
<v Ajit Panaskar>want to monitor if number of
infrastructure.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/302-0
00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:06.603
<v Ajit Panaskar>Was increasing.
So you that tool should have that</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/302-1
00:15:06.603 --> 00:15:11.685
<v Ajit Panaskar>capability to configure the Uh newly
added infrastructure for monitoring.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/302-2
00:15:11.685 --> 00:15:16.629
<v Ajit Panaskar>So then it should have the good
visualization capability in the form of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/300-0
00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:12.009
<v Amit Hiremath>And.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/302-3
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:18.209
<v Ajit Panaskar>dashboards. Uh then uh.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/307-0
00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:24.194
<v Ajit Panaskar>Cost is very important while selecting
the monitoring tool and again the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/307-1
00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:28.128
<v Ajit Panaskar>community.
If it is in open source how you can it</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/307-2
00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:32.535
<v Ajit Panaskar>will be supported by the community for
any new add-ons.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/307-3
00:15:32.535 --> 00:15:37.729
<v Ajit Panaskar>Now let us say now I will just give two
differences between what?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/312-0
00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:43.516
<v Ajit Panaskar>Exactly is the monitoring and what is the
observability and what is the difference.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/312-1
00:15:43.516 --> 00:15:48.775
<v Ajit Panaskar>So basically let us take one case study
where you observe that let us say we have</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/312-2
00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:53.777
<v Ajit Panaskar>one e-commerce website and like on Friday
when you observe that there are the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/312-3
00:15:53.777 --> 00:15:57.369
<v Ajit Panaskar>number of usage of that e-commerce system
is very high.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/316-0
00:15:57.849 --> 00:16:03.502
<v Ajit Panaskar>So when our goal is that if there is any
spike in the usage of that site,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/316-1
00:16:03.502 --> 00:16:09.461
<v Ajit Panaskar>you should ensure that the site is up and
running irrespective of even though</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/316-2
00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:14.961
<v Ajit Panaskar>number of users are growing.
So that that is our business goal ideally.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/316-3
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:17.329
<v Ajit Panaskar>So now how to ensure that high?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/320-0
00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:23.122
<v Ajit Panaskar>Like the scalability, Yep in such cases.
So you should have some metrics in place</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/320-1
00:16:23.122 --> 00:16:26.815
<v Ajit Panaskar>where if you observe that CPU utilization
goes high,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/320-2
00:16:26.815 --> 00:16:31.692
<v Ajit Panaskar>then we should be able to add new
instances to the to the like to the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/320-3
00:16:31.692 --> 00:16:34.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>system. So that is how that monitoring.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/325-0
00:16:34.769 --> 00:16:38.945
<v Ajit Panaskar>But it will what the action it will take
is that it will increase the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/325-1
00:16:38.945 --> 00:16:42.405
<v Ajit Panaskar>infrastructure right or the instances
based on the usage.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/325-2
00:16:42.405 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Ajit Panaskar>So that that comes under the monitoring
because what exactly it is doing.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/325-3
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.055
<v Ajit Panaskar>So it is just checking if any spikes
happens then it will increase the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/325-4
00:16:51.055 --> 00:16:52.129
<v Ajit Panaskar>instances that is.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/329-0
00:16:52.369 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Ajit Panaskar>That is the,
I will say the reactive approach that</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/329-1
00:16:55.670 --> 00:17:00.719
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitoring takes monitoring system take.
But now if you compare this with the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/329-2
00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:04.345
<v Ajit Panaskar>observability,
so consider the observability is like if</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/329-3
00:17:04.345 --> 00:17:09.329
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitoring gives you what exactly is to
be done, the observability give you.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/334-0
00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.612
<v Ajit Panaskar>Why something could not happen and what
action you should take.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/334-1
00:17:13.612 --> 00:17:17.226
<v Ajit Panaskar>So monitoring refers to what actually you
have to do.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/334-2
00:17:17.226 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Ajit Panaskar>But monitoring observability just ensures
that why it did not happen.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/334-3
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.729
<v Ajit Panaskar>Maybe for example let us now this let us
take another case study where.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/338-0
00:17:27.009 --> 00:17:30.579
<v Ajit Panaskar>Like user,
the scenario is that micro services it</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/338-1
00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:36.291
<v Ajit Panaskar>generally observability comes under a
complex system and monitoring comes under</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/338-2
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:39.718
<v Ajit Panaskar>a very traditional or a monolithic
application.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/338-3
00:17:39.718 --> 00:17:45.501
<v Ajit Panaskar>So when there is a distributed system and
the micro services are deployed on the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/338-4
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:46.929
<v Ajit Panaskar>clouds and they are.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/343-0
00:17:47.129 --> 00:17:51.554
<v Ajit Panaskar>Like hosted on the Kubernetes.
So you need to check like there are</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/343-1
00:17:51.554 --> 00:17:56.441
<v Ajit Panaskar>multiple like components or the services
interacting with each other in a</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/343-2
00:17:56.441 --> 00:18:00.932
<v Ajit Panaskar>sequential flow for example.
So like for example order order system</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/343-3
00:18:00.932 --> 00:18:04.036
<v Ajit Panaskar>right?
So once you place an order then it will</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/343-4
00:18:04.036 --> 00:18:05.489
<v Ajit Panaskar>check into the invent.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/347-0
00:18:06.689 --> 00:18:07.169
<v Ajit Panaskar>3 and.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/349-0
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:10.727
<v Ajit Panaskar>And once it is available,
it will then redirect to the payment</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/349-1
00:18:10.727 --> 00:18:14.851
<v Ajit Panaskar>gateway. So in in case for example,
let us understand that the inventory</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/349-2
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:18.183
<v Ajit Panaskar>system is taking somewhat time for five
second to respond.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/349-3
00:18:18.183 --> 00:18:20.838
<v Ajit Panaskar>But now if you have this proper
observability,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/349-4
00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:25.357
<v Ajit Panaskar>so observability is nothing but you are
tracking each and every microservice to</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/349-5
00:18:25.357 --> 00:18:26.769
<v Ajit Panaskar>with the help of sensors.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/354-0
00:18:26.849 --> 00:18:31.198
<v Ajit Panaskar>That this how that microservice is
behaving and if any let us say any</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/354-1
00:18:31.198 --> 00:18:35.921
<v Ajit Panaskar>dependent microservice will fail,
definitely it will have the impact on the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/354-2
00:18:35.921 --> 00:18:38.965
<v Ajit Panaskar>first microserving or the invoking
microservice.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/354-3
00:18:38.965 --> 00:18:43.812
<v Ajit Panaskar>So you should if you apply let us say
some correlation ID mechanism where you</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/354-4
00:18:43.812 --> 00:18:46.049
<v Ajit Panaskar>are tracking each and every request.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/358-0
00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:51.224
<v Ajit Panaskar>Along all these micro services.
So with the help of that correlation ID</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/358-1
00:18:51.224 --> 00:18:55.919
<v Ajit Panaskar>you will come to know that this
particular microservice took let us say</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/358-2
00:18:55.919 --> 00:19:00.092
<v Ajit Panaskar>this much of amount like because of some
error in the database.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/358-3
00:19:00.092 --> 00:19:05.243
<v Ajit Panaskar>So let us say here in the case of this
case study the inventory is taking some</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/358-4
00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:05.569
<v Ajit Panaskar>time.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/362-0
00:19:06.489 --> 00:19:11.785
<v Ajit Panaskar>Because it is like fetching some of the
records from the database and let us say</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/362-1
00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:16.753
<v Ajit Panaskar>the database service itself is maybe
itself it is not responding because of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/362-2
00:19:16.753 --> 00:19:22.049
<v Ajit Panaskar>the high processing or CPU caused by the
some another service service B. So now.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/366-0
00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:26.692
<v Ajit Panaskar>It is observed that database something
maybe the database is not like working</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/366-1
00:19:26.692 --> 00:19:30.085
<v Ajit Panaskar>properly because of some issues in
another microservice,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/366-2
00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:32.942
<v Ajit Panaskar>but it is having that impact on
microservice A.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/366-3
00:19:32.942 --> 00:19:37.049
<v Ajit Panaskar>So now once we with the help of
correlation ID we track the problem.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/371-0
00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:42.547
<v Ajit Panaskar>Exact point of failure or the exact root
cause is the service B which is causing</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/371-1
00:19:42.547 --> 00:19:47.186
<v Ajit Panaskar>problem in database and because of that
the inventory micro services is</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/371-2
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:50.729
<v Ajit Panaskar>responding slow.
So these observabilities give you the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/371-3
00:19:50.729 --> 00:19:55.367
<v Ajit Panaskar>exact cause or the root cause why the
overall system is not functioning</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/371-4
00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:56.849
<v Ajit Panaskar>properly and then once.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/375-0
00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:57.049
<v Ajit Panaskar>To.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/377-0
00:19:57.089 --> 00:20:00.668
<v Ajit Panaskar>To identify that this particular service
is causing problem,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/377-1
00:20:00.668 --> 00:20:05.479
<v Ajit Panaskar>maybe you have either revamped the code
in such a way that the database calls are</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/377-2
00:20:05.479 --> 00:20:08.707
<v Ajit Panaskar>taking slow,
the stored procedures are executing slow.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/377-3
00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:13.401
<v Ajit Panaskar>So you get that exact point of I will say
the root cause for the misbehavior of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/377-4
00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:16.569
<v Ajit Panaskar>that service.
So that is how where the observability.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/382-0
00:20:17.169 --> 00:20:22.155
<v Ajit Panaskar>Comes into picture and then you can here.
If you observe that here the system is</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/382-1
00:20:22.155 --> 00:20:27.018
<v Ajit Panaskar>like working, everything is fine right?
If you just monitor that health checks</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/382-2
00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:30.158
<v Ajit Panaskar>and all,
you will find that the other services are</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/382-3
00:20:30.158 --> 00:20:35.144
<v Ajit Panaskar>up and running. The CPU is also normal,
but you don't know exactly where exactly</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/382-4
00:20:35.144 --> 00:20:36.129
<v Ajit Panaskar>is causing that.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/386-0
00:20:36.729 --> 00:20:39.073
<v Ajit Panaskar>Problem.
So observability helps you to</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/386-1
00:20:39.073 --> 00:20:42.620
<v Ajit Panaskar>troubleshoot more with the help of
correlation ID and all.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/386-2
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.188
<v Ajit Panaskar>So that is where the observability plays
a like significant role instead of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/386-3
00:20:47.188 --> 00:20:47.849
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitoring.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/387-0
00:20:47.569 --> 00:20:49.729
<v Amit Hiremath>Makes sense.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/392-0
00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:57.995
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK. This emerging trends in monitoring,
these are the latest trends.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/392-1
00:20:57.995 --> 00:21:03.106
<v Ajit Panaskar>I will say AIML based predictive
monitoring we we can apply then</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/392-2
00:21:03.106 --> 00:21:09.318
<v Ajit Panaskar>observability platforms just we discussed
automation maybe what yeah if we can</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/392-3
00:21:09.318 --> 00:21:10.969
<v Ajit Panaskar>automate some of the.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/396-0
00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:16.578
<v Ajit Panaskar>Processes in this troubleshooting so that
is a that comes under the automation and</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/396-1
00:21:16.578 --> 00:21:20.612
<v Ajit Panaskar>the self healing systems,
cloud native container monitoring,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/396-2
00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:25.241
<v Ajit Panaskar>age computing and IoT monitoring.
So these are the emerging trends in</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/396-3
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:25.969
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitoring.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/401-0
00:21:27.689 --> 00:21:30.397
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK,
challenges data overloaded like there</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/401-1
00:21:30.397 --> 00:21:35.554
<v Ajit Panaskar>since we are having millions of logs.
So we like the main challenge is like how</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/401-2
00:21:35.554 --> 00:21:40.389
<v Ajit Panaskar>to deal with this huge volumes of data
and how to keep the backup of this.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/401-3
00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:45.804
<v Ajit Panaskar>So that is a challenge then complexity of
integration with cloud native systems and</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/401-4
00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:46.449
<v Ajit Panaskar>Microsoft.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/405-0
00:21:47.649 --> 00:21:53.859
<v Ajit Panaskar>Services for the distributed architecture
then cost management again it comes yeah</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/405-1
00:21:53.859 --> 00:21:59.995
<v Ajit Panaskar>because of the like advanced capabilities
then tools may go at a higher cost side</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/405-2
00:21:59.995 --> 00:22:02.689
<v Ajit Panaskar>so that also we need to check so as.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/410-0
00:22:03.369 --> 00:22:08.652
<v Ajit Panaskar>Then log analytic workspace.
It comes under the Azure actually Azure</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/410-1
00:22:08.652 --> 00:22:13.705
<v Ajit Panaskar>site where are the different types of
logs be it let us say HTTP.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/410-2
00:22:13.705 --> 00:22:20.060
<v Ajit Panaskar>If you want to track the request incoming
request where those are coming then what</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/410-3
00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.969
<v Ajit Panaskar>are the different maybe like external?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/414-0
00:22:23.169 --> 00:22:29.321
<v Ajit Panaskar>Calls like database calls, exceptions,
traces so which you can like I will store</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/414-1
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:34.259
<v Ajit Panaskar>in the log analytics workspace.
So that is comes under the Azure</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/414-2
00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:37.449
<v Ajit Panaskar>Application Insights and Azure Monitoring.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/418-0
00:22:39.129 --> 00:22:46.433
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK, so yeah,
now let us go to one case study which we</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/418-1
00:22:46.433 --> 00:22:49.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>applied for Nazam for.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/417-0
00:22:50.529 --> 00:22:51.249
<v Amit Hiremath>Mm-hmm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/428-0
00:23:07.569 --> 00:23:12.416
<v Ajit Panaskar>So, OK,
we're in the discussion with the Nazam</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/428-1
00:23:12.416 --> 00:23:20.769
<v Ajit Panaskar>customer and what we observe these are
the pin points which yeah Nazam is facing</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/428-2
00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:22.729
<v Ajit Panaskar>currently. So like.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/434-0
00:23:25.129 --> 00:23:29.743
<v Ajit Panaskar>Let us say OK,
So what one use case we observed here is</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/434-1
00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:36.664
<v Ajit Panaskar>that the rabbit MQ we had used the rabbit
MQ for asynchronous communication between</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/434-2
00:23:36.664 --> 00:23:42.679
<v Ajit Panaskar>the multiple services and one scenario
was that one exchange was I think</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/434-3
00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:44.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>accidentally deleted.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/438-0
00:23:44.929 --> 00:23:51.938
<v Ajit Panaskar>In the corporate fleet I believe and then
but it was though it was deleted because</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/438-1
00:23:51.938 --> 00:23:58.862
<v Ajit Panaskar>of that exchange deletion the I will say
the messages that suppose that that were</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/438-2
00:23:58.862 --> 00:24:04.689
<v Ajit Panaskar>supposed to be consumed by the worker
application so that since the.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/443-0
00:24:04.689 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Ajit Panaskar>The exchange was itself deleted.
The worker was unable to retrieve all the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/443-1
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:16.067
<v Ajit Panaskar>messages from the rabbit MQ and then
process it for the corporate fleet and</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/443-2
00:24:16.067 --> 00:24:22.170
<v Ajit Panaskar>that issue was like ongoing and it did
not bring into notice because there was a</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/443-3
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.129
<v Ajit Panaskar>lack of monitoring or the.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/450-0
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:29.037
<v Ajit Panaskar>The team was not properly having any
heartbeat or health check mechanism.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/450-1
00:24:29.037 --> 00:24:32.352
<v Ajit Panaskar>So like it was,
it was having a direct impact on the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/450-2
00:24:32.352 --> 00:24:37.480
<v Ajit Panaskar>business because if you're let us say the
messages are not consumed by the worker</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/445-0
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.209
<v Amit Hiremath>Mm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/450-3
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.857
<v Ajit Panaskar>application,
so it was like just it was residing into</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/448-0
00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:41.129
<v Amit Hiremath>Face.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/450-4
00:24:40.857 --> 00:24:43.609
<v Ajit Panaskar>the database but no action was being
taken.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/456-0
00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:49.399
<v Ajit Panaskar>So that's why the volume of that data was
increasing and I I was told that it was</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/456-1
00:24:49.399 --> 00:24:54.183
<v Ajit Panaskar>like since last three to four months that
those logs or the messages are still kept</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/456-2
00:24:54.183 --> 00:24:58.682
<v Ajit Panaskar>in the database without any processing.
So then we after 3-4 months we came to</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/453-0
00:24:56.689 --> 00:24:56.969
<v Amit Hiremath>Mm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/456-3
00:24:58.682 --> 00:25:02.782
<v Ajit Panaskar>know that this is the problem.
Now we thought that if we could have got</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/456-4
00:25:02.782 --> 00:25:03.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>some alert.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/461-0
00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:09.013
<v Ajit Panaskar>Right. That this, for example,
this number of volumes of data which are</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/461-1
00:25:09.013 --> 00:25:12.392
<v Ajit Panaskar>unprocessed,
those are growing more than what we</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/461-2
00:25:12.392 --> 00:25:16.874
<v Ajit Panaskar>expect on a daily basis.
So if we could have such a mechanism in</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/461-3
00:25:16.874 --> 00:25:21.425
<v Ajit Panaskar>place in the form of alert,
so definitely we could have yet taken</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/461-4
00:25:21.425 --> 00:25:23.769
<v Ajit Panaskar>that action at the earlier stages.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/466-0
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:30.033
<v Ajit Panaskar>Instead of maybe reported by the customer.
So such there was this actual real time</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/466-1
00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:33.777
<v Ajit Panaskar>case we observed.
Then the another use case was that</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/466-2
00:25:33.777 --> 00:25:39.499
<v Ajit Panaskar>sometimes we observe that the hang fire
job itself is sometimes maybe it is down</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/466-3
00:25:39.499 --> 00:25:43.809
<v Ajit Panaskar>and the hang fire services are stopped
but we are unable to.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/472-0
00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:47.664
<v Ajit Panaskar>No at a earlier stage.
So because there is no any like maybe</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/472-1
00:25:47.664 --> 00:25:50.951
<v Ajit Panaskar>health check we are applied at the hang
fire level.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/472-2
00:25:50.951 --> 00:25:55.692
<v Ajit Panaskar>So whether we we don't know with that
hang fire is up and not then then on</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/468-0
00:25:52.409 --> 00:25:52.649
<v Amit Hiremath>Hmm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/472-3
00:25:55.692 --> 00:26:00.874
<v Ajit Panaskar>maybe and at some point of day we just go
to that server and observe that oh this</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/472-4
00:26:00.874 --> 00:26:03.529
<v Ajit Panaskar>hang fire, this hang fire service is down.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/477-0
00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:09.140
<v Ajit Panaskar>Then we manually go and start it.
So that is also another problem which we</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/471-0
00:26:06.249 --> 00:26:06.489
<v Amit Hiremath>Hmm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/477-1
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.531
<v Ajit Panaskar>face.
So that let us say these two cases where</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/477-2
00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:18.374
<v Ajit Panaskar>the real time we faced for Nazam and for
what now what we decided is that let us</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/477-3
00:26:18.374 --> 00:26:23.569
<v Ajit Panaskar>say for example if we have some this is
the architecture diagram which.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/482-0
00:26:23.649 --> 00:26:28.583
<v Ajit Panaskar>Like we prepared along with Tushar Yusuf.
So you can see that this is,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/482-1
00:26:28.583 --> 00:26:34.073
<v Ajit Panaskar>I will say the approach we can take.
We can categorize this in three sections.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/482-2
00:26:34.073 --> 00:26:37.062
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK.
The first as you observed here is that</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/482-3
00:26:37.062 --> 00:26:42.413
<v Ajit Panaskar>these are the different endpoints, OK,
be it a rabbit MQ, be it a APG proxy,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/482-4
00:26:42.413 --> 00:26:42.969
<v Ajit Panaskar>be it a.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/487-0
00:26:43.329 --> 00:26:47.535
<v Ajit Panaskar>Signal R and the API endpoints.
So let us say we will have one.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/487-1
00:26:47.535 --> 00:26:52.990
<v Ajit Panaskar>I will say it's a hill check right where
we will just check whether that rabbit MQ</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/487-2
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:57.525
<v Ajit Panaskar>node is up and running or not,
whether that particular API is, yeah,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/487-3
00:26:57.525 --> 00:27:01.403
<v Ajit Panaskar>functioning properly,
whether all those AP APG proxies are</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/487-4
00:27:01.403 --> 00:27:02.849
<v Ajit Panaskar>configured in the APG.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/491-0
00:27:02.849 --> 00:27:07.082
<v Ajit Panaskar>Level or not.
So such kind of health check we can apply</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/491-1
00:27:07.082 --> 00:27:11.845
<v Ajit Panaskar>OK just to know that these services are
up and running or not.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/491-2
00:27:11.845 --> 00:27:17.968
<v Ajit Panaskar>Then another I will say that concept is
that heartbeat right as explained in the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/491-3
00:27:17.968 --> 00:27:20.009
<v Ajit Panaskar>case of corporate fleet so.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/496-0
00:27:20.569 --> 00:27:26.139
<v Ajit Panaskar>There was a business failure because of
the deletion of the Rabbit MQ exchange.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/496-1
00:27:26.139 --> 00:27:31.153
<v Ajit Panaskar>The data was already stored in the
database for more than three months.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/496-2
00:27:31.153 --> 00:27:36.236
<v Ajit Panaskar>So if we can monitor the business
failures by going through the database</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/496-3
00:27:36.236 --> 00:27:39.369
<v Ajit Panaskar>transaction system,
let us say the conflict.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/501-0
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:40.729
<v Ajit Panaskar>You.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/503-0
00:27:40.969 --> 00:27:45.147
<v Ajit Panaskar>Its own transaction database and it is
having the transaction table.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/503-1
00:27:45.147 --> 00:27:49.870
<v Ajit Panaskar>So if we can check those transaction
table volumes and if we identify that it</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/503-2
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:54.533
<v Ajit Panaskar>is deviating from the standard case,
so you can use that heartbeat mechanism</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/503-3
00:27:54.533 --> 00:27:59.135
<v Ajit Panaskar>which will check all those database
transaction system every let us say one</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/503-4
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:00.649
<v Ajit Panaskar>hour and we can identify.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/507-0
00:28:00.849 --> 00:28:03.775
<v Ajit Panaskar>A deviation with the help of this
heartbeat.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/507-1
00:28:03.775 --> 00:28:07.677
<v Ajit Panaskar>This is the second use case where we can
use the heartbeat.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/507-2
00:28:07.677 --> 00:28:12.425
<v Ajit Panaskar>The third I will say the scenario is that
the micro services right where</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/507-3
00:28:12.425 --> 00:28:17.758
<v Ajit Panaskar>observability comes to and with the help
of the correlation ID you can track each</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/507-4
00:28:17.758 --> 00:28:20.489
<v Ajit Panaskar>request. So if you would like to know why.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/512-0
00:28:21.009 --> 00:28:26.107
<v Ajit Panaskar>Some for example this micro services
causing high processing time so you can</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/512-1
00:28:26.107 --> 00:28:30.676
<v Ajit Panaskar>with the help of query ID you can track
all those the micro services</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/512-2
00:28:30.676 --> 00:28:34.781
<v Ajit Panaskar>communication also.
So these three if you have one let us say</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/512-3
00:28:34.781 --> 00:28:39.879
<v Ajit Panaskar>A1 application where you can configure
all these three scenarios and you can</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/512-4
00:28:39.879 --> 00:28:40.409
<v Ajit Panaskar>monitor.</v>

<v Amit Hiremath>have we completed the Nginx part?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/665-0
00:40:37.089 --> 00:40:41.618
<v Aashish Sonawane>Yes, Amit, I think, uh,
the other part is remaining the DevOps</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/665-1
00:40:41.618 --> 00:40:42.049
<v Aashish Sonawane>thing.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/667-0
00:40:43.129 --> 00:40:52.209
<v Amit Hiremath>Uh, yeah. And and then the the,
I think Rakesh from AWS infrastructure.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/666-0
00:40:44.369 --> 00:40:45.769
<v Aashish Sonawane>Engineering system.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/669-0
00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:59.214
<v Amit Hiremath>Dilip this video, audio,
language translation that is remaining,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/669-1
00:40:59.214 --> 00:40:59.569

00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:07.529
<v Amit Hiremath>And and then the liability detection also
I think we've not completed.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/671-0
00:41:06.769 --> 00:41:06.889
<v Dilip Kachot>Oh.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/674-0
00:41:08.849 --> 00:41:15.824
<v Amit Hiremath>Then fast optimization of AWS cloud.
I think this is the remaining jug Jagbhan.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/673-0
00:41:09.209 --> 00:41:09.449
<v Dilip Kachot>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/674-1

<v Aashish Sonawane>Sure, sure, sure. I'll check with them.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/676-0
00:41:23.249 --> 00:41:26.849
<v Amit Hiremath>And then a disarm of high trust is also
not done I think.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/677-0
00:41:26.729 --> 00:41:29.969
<v Aashish Sonawane>Huh. This one is remaining from my.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/679-0
00:41:29.449 --> 00:41:32.731
<v Amit Hiremath>Right,
so I think I think Nginx is not done.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/679-1
00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:35.941
<v Amit Hiremath>I don't.
I've not marked it as done because</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/679-2
00:41:35.941 --> 00:41:40.609
<v Amit Hiremath>usually what I do is when it is done,
I mark it as done on the.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/678-0
00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:36.969
<v Aashish Sonawane>Oh.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/680-0
00:41:42.169 --> 00:41:45.529
<v Aashish Sonawane>But I'm not sure, but it was done.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/681-0
00:41:47.529 --> 00:41:50.809
<v Amit Hiremath>Can you just check?
Can you ping me in that group?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/682-0
00:41:51.849 --> 00:41:52.809
<v Aashish Sonawane>Yes, yes.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/683-0
00:41:53.409 --> 00:41:55.628
<v Amit Hiremath>Vijay,

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/683-1
00:41:55.628 --> 00:41:56.329
<v Amit Hiremath>scalability?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/684-0
00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:01.529
<v Vijay Nadar>That is pending. I'll come check with you.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/689-0
00:42:00.009 --> 00:42:03.024
<v Amit Hiremath>So,
so can you guys just make sure that you</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/685-0
00:42:02.609 --> 00:42:03.089
<v Vijay Nadar>Mhm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/689-1
00:42:03.024 --> 00:42:08.507
<v Amit Hiremath>know you follow up with me and we get
this recorded. Usually what I do is I'll,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/686-0
00:42:04.209 --> 00:42:05.649
<v Vijay Nadar>Yeah, yeah, we'll do it.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/687-0
00:42:06.889 --> 00:42:07.209
<v Vijay Nadar>Yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/689-2
00:42:08.507 --> 00:42:13.715
<v Amit Hiremath>I'll just show you how how I mark it.
So once I complete I mark it as done.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/689-3
00:42:13.715 --> 00:42:18.032
<v Amit Hiremath>So usually I do that.
I think I don't see that done for these.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/689-4
00:42:18.032 --> 00:42:19.129
<v Amit Hiremath>So you see like.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/692-0
00:42:19.409 --> 00:42:22.258
<v Amit Hiremath>These are all done, done, done, on hold,
whatever.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/692-1
00:42:22.258 --> 00:42:24.940
<v Amit Hiremath>And then like Mayuk's guy's done,
this is done.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/692-2
00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.237
<v Amit Hiremath>So these are remaining and and Genx is
not marked as done.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/692-3
00:42:28.237 --> 00:42:29.969
<v Amit Hiremath>So maybe we need to just check.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/694-0
00:42:31.009 --> 00:42:34.514
<v Amit Hiremath>Maybe we recorded it and we were to
rerecord it something like that,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/694-1
00:42:34.514 --> 00:42:37.409
<v Amit Hiremath>maybe because the first one was not
correct or whatever.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/697-0
00:42:39.009 --> 00:42:42.889
<v Aashish Sonawane>Maybe, yeah, yeah,
we can rerecord if required.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/696-0
00:42:40.529 --> 00:42:41.689
<v Amit Hiremath>The check once up.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/704-0
00:42:42.689 --> 00:42:46.972
<v Amit Hiremath>I don't know if it is recorded and we
have shared with the marketing team.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/704-1
00:42:46.972 --> 00:42:50.569
<v Amit Hiremath>I can mark it as done,
but just ping me in that group wherever</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/704-2
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:55.138
<v Amit Hiremath>it may be. I'm not search for it. Dilip,
I think two things Nimeri and DSOM for</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/700-0
00:42:51.129 --> 00:42:52.729
<v Aashish Sonawane>Sure, sure, sure.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/704-3
00:42:55.138 --> 00:42:59.649
<v Amit Hiremath>Hitus and cost optimization by Rakesh.
This is something that we need to take.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/708-0
00:43:01.689 --> 00:43:06.772
<v Amit Hiremath>Sorry, disaster recovery of AWS.
This is Jagbhan and Vinita.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/703-0
00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:02.649
<v Vijay Nadar>Hmm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/708-1
00:43:06.772 --> 00:43:11.272
<v Amit Hiremath>So maybe Ashish,
you can check disaster recovery cost</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/708-2
00:43:11.272 --> 00:43:16.689
<v Amit Hiremath>optimization. This is from Jagbhan again.
This is again Jagbhan.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/710-0
00:43:17.169 --> 00:43:20.157
<v Amit Hiremath>And this one is Rakesh.
I think the study code is up.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/710-1
00:43:20.157 --> 00:43:23.089
<v Amit Hiremath>There's one for Rakesh.
I'm not sure which was that.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/713-0
00:43:24.049 --> 00:43:28.708
<v Amit Hiremath>Oh, AWS infrastructure cost saving.
But these two seem to be same cost</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/713-1
00:43:28.708 --> 00:43:34.089
<v Amit Hiremath>optimization of AWS cloud and AWS cost.
So I think maybe we can take it together.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/715-0
00:43:34.769 --> 00:43:37.849
<v Aashish Sonawane>OK, with all three or Rakesh and Jagpal.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/719-0
00:43:36.529 --> 00:43:39.682
<v Amit Hiremath>So Rakesh, you, me and Jagbhan,
we can do it together.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/719-1
00:43:39.682 --> 00:43:44.210
<v Amit Hiremath>So if you can just remind them or maybe
create a group and just remind them on</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/716-0
00:43:40.809 --> 00:43:42.009
<v Aashish Sonawane>OK, sure.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/719-2
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.789
<v Amit Hiremath>that, I'll share.
Once you create the group,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/719-3
00:43:46.789 --> 00:43:49.369
<v Amit Hiremath>I'll share this loop link with them in
that.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/720-0
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:52.009
<v Aashish Sonawane>OK. Yeah.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/722-0

<v Amit Hiremath>that are subjects, guys? Muzaffar, Vijay,
Ajit, Kishore.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/723-0

00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:11.009
<v Amit Hiremath>So if there are any,
please suggest so that we can take it up.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/726-0
00:44:11.049 --> 00:44:16.289
<v Vijay Nadar>Yeah, means I've added that case study,
not the podcast for blockchain I added.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/725-0
00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:12.929

<v Amit Hiremath>we are doing in Saudi Arabia. Actually,
I think I'm not updated.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/735-3

<v Amit Hiremath>Sama,

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/738-1

<v Amit Hiremath>Authority,
Sama funded companies as they are called,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/738-2

<v Amit Hiremath>they have a public trust and then public
investment fund PIF funded companies.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/738-3
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:33.849
<v Amit Hiremath>So we are approaching them.
We have shortlisted and we are kind of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/738-4
00:45:33.849 --> 00:45:38.409
<v Amit Hiremath>doing a campaign with them. That is one.

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/739-0
00:45:39.049 --> 00:45:43.667
<v Amit Hiremath>Now with a couple called as Uptiq, UPTIQ,
they are into financial agentic AI.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/739-1
00:45:43.667 --> 00:45:46.804
<v Amit Hiremath>They're already a very successful company
in the US.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/739-2
00:45:46.804 --> 00:45:50.830

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/739-4
00:45:54.323 --> 00:45:55.329
<v Amit Hiremath>So they are very.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/741-0

00:46:01.134 --> 00:46:06.649
<v Amit Hiremath>with them again for this Sama company,
especially for the financial companies.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/740-0
00:46:03.729 --> 00:46:03.929
<v Aashish Sonawane>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/743-0
00:46:07.769 --> 00:46:14.055
<v Amit Hiremath>So those two are very unique offerings
and like one of the things Vijay which we</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/742-0
00:46:08.489 --> 00:46:08.969
<v Dilip Kachot>Mhm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/743-1
00:46:14.055 --> 00:46:18.945
<v Amit Hiremath>may want to kind of take up,
I'm not sure Vijay as Vijay left.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/743-2
00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:24.688
<v Amit Hiremath>So is about this uptick since it's a
financial agentic AI looks like SAMA</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/743-3
00:46:24.688 --> 00:46:27.249
<v Amit Hiremath>which is a so monetary authority.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/744-0
00:46:27.289 --> 00:46:32.681
<v Amit Hiremath>As a sandbox in Saudi Arabia and if we
run or execute or implement this tool on</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/744-1
00:46:32.681 --> 00:46:36.927
<v Amit Hiremath>their sandbox successfully,
then it becomes certified by SAMA.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/744-2
00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:41.914
<v Amit Hiremath>So that's something that we are looking
at and there's there are not many</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/744-3
00:46:41.914 --> 00:46:45.351
<v Amit Hiremath>companies in AI,
in agentic AI in Saudi Arabia and</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/744-4
00:46:45.351 --> 00:46:46.969
<v Amit Hiremath>especially in financial.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/746-0
00:46:47.249 --> 00:46:51.260
<v Amit Hiremath>So that is a a a greater opportunity.
So these two are very unique ways of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/746-1
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.309
<v Amit Hiremath>going. We've not,
we've never gone into market with this</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/746-2
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:57.679
<v Amit Hiremath>kind of an offering.
We've been always saying that we are good</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/745-0
00:46:56.369 --> 00:46:56.449
<v Aashish Sonawane>Um.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/746-3
00:46:57.679 --> 00:47:00.995
<v Amit Hiremath>at testing, we are good at dotnet,
we're good at Python, PHP,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/746-4
00:47:00.995 --> 00:47:04.471
<v Amit Hiremath>but we never said that OK,
we are a partner with the company and</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/746-5
00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:05.969
<v Amit Hiremath>we're going into the market.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/748-0
00:47:06.049 --> 00:47:12.420
<v Amit Hiremath>So that's kind of something that you know.
So basically we are trying to go with the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/748-1
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.816
<v Amit Hiremath>flow because AI is something that we need
to go with the some offering.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/748-2
00:47:17.816 --> 00:47:21.489
<v Amit Hiremath>We cannot just go, OK,
we know everything in AI.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/749-0
00:47:21.489 --> 00:47:23.849
<v Amit Hiremath>So that is what we are trying to
capitalize on.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/747-0
00:47:21.649 --> 00:47:21.689

00:48:51.255 --> 00:48:55.459
<v Amit Hiremath>implementation of different workflows,
which basically it implements the</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/767-2
00:48:55.459 --> 00:48:58.569

00:49:00.169 --> 00:49:02.841
<v Aashish Sonawane>OK.
So it would be more like a development or</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/768-1
00:49:02.841 --> 00:49:05.049

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/770-1
00:49:07.877 --> 00:49:11.138
<v Amit Hiremath>agent AI,
it needs to connect with lot of other</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/770-2
00:49:11.138 --> 00:49:15.009
<v Amit Hiremath>services, right?

<v Amit Hiremath>discussing with a prospect perspective
partner who has a bank.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/771-0
00:49:19.729 --> 00:49:23.638
<v Amit Hiremath>In Oman as a customer and what they're
looking for is what they call as a</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/771-1
00:49:23.638 --> 00:49:26.015
<v Amit Hiremath>correspondence management system for a
bank.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/771-2

<v Amit Hiremath>anybody who corresponds with the bank,

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/771-4
00:49:33.781 --> 00:49:36.369
<v Amit Hiremath>it could be another bank,
it could be customers.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/772-0
00:49:36.689 --> 00:49:41.504
<v Amit Hiremath>It could be regulatory authorities,
compliance authorities or all that, right?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/772-1
00:49:41.504 --> 00:49:45.038
<v Amit Hiremath>So anybody could be,
and there could be multiple modes of</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/772-2
00:49:45.038 --> 00:49:48.025
<v Amit Hiremath>communication.
It could be actual physical name,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/772-3
00:49:48.025 --> 00:49:50.767
<v Amit Hiremath>it could be an e-mail,
it could be a portal,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/772-4
00:49:50.767 --> 00:49:52.169
<v Amit Hiremath>it could be a chat bot.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/773-0
00:49:52.769 --> 00:49:55.598
<v Amit Hiremath>It could be a help desk,
it could be anything, right?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/773-1
00:49:55.598 --> 00:49:59.736
<v Amit Hiremath>Then what they want is correspondence
management system so that any of the any</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/773-2
00:49:59.736 --> 00:50:03.979
<v Amit Hiremath>of these channels you receive something,
we should be able to identify what that</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/773-3
00:50:03.979 --> 00:50:07.698
<v Amit Hiremath>communication is and then route it
through the respective departments,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/773-4
00:50:07.698 --> 00:50:09.689
<v Amit Hiremath>functions, whatever, you know all the.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/774-0
00:50:11.009 --> 00:50:13.643
<v Amit Hiremath>And then get an entire feedback and you
know,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/774-1
00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:18.052
<v Amit Hiremath>give the answer to that and all that,
right? Look for closures and all that.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/774-2
00:50:18.052 --> 00:50:22.002
<v Amit Hiremath>So right now they're doing it manually.
They want to build a system.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/774-3
00:50:22.002 --> 00:50:26.239
<v Amit Hiremath>So this uptick agent AI becomes very
useful. So one is the agent AI part.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/774-4
00:50:26.239 --> 00:50:28.129
<v Amit Hiremath>So you'll need to kind of really.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/775-0
00:50:28.369 --> 00:50:30.962
<v Amit Hiremath>Prepare the agentic AI or create that
workflow,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/775-1
00:50:30.962 --> 00:50:34.366
<v Amit Hiremath>but also it needs to integrate with a
portal help desk system.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/775-2
00:50:34.366 --> 00:50:37.878
<v Amit Hiremath>So as soon as a ticket is created I we
should be able to get it.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/775-3
00:50:37.878 --> 00:50:40.741
<v Amit Hiremath>So there is an API connection that we
need to build.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/775-4
00:50:40.741 --> 00:50:45.280
<v Amit Hiremath>Then suppose if we need to send an e-mail
to the you know some function so it needs</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/775-5
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.089
<v Amit Hiremath>to be sent that e-mail and it should wait
for that.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/776-0
00:50:48.289 --> 00:50:52.494
<v Amit Hiremath>E-mail to come back and as a response so
it should get all the details.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/776-1
00:50:52.494 --> 00:50:57.225
<v Amit Hiremath>But suppose if it is supposed to call any
of their APIs in their banking system,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/776-2
00:50:57.225 --> 00:51:01.080
<v Amit Hiremath>we need to call that so that integration
needs to be implemented.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/776-3
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.233
<v Amit Hiremath>So apart from just customization of the
agent agents,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/776-4
00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:07.329
<v Amit Hiremath>it's also about the integrations with
other systems.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/777-0
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.729
<v Amit Hiremath>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/780-0
00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:14.529
<v Dilip Kachot>It may give a platform to create all this
workflow which.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/786-0
00:51:13.329 --> 00:51:16.579
<v Amit Hiremath>Absolutely.
And there's so much scope for innovation,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/778-0
00:51:13.809 --> 00:51:14.529
<v Aashish Sonawane>Mhm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/781-0
00:51:16.169 --> 00:51:16.689
<v Dilip Kachot>Mhm.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/786-1
00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:20.130
<v Amit Hiremath>right? Like, you know,
once the basic workflow is working,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/786-2
00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:23.561
<v Amit Hiremath>so then you get.
So you rather than you spending time in</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/786-3
00:51:23.561 --> 00:51:27.232
<v Amit Hiremath>developing that entire workflow from
scratch, you are ready.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/786-4
00:51:27.232 --> 00:51:31.084
<v Amit Hiremath>You have got it ready now.
Now you can go to the next level of,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/782-0
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:30.129
<v Dilip Kachot>Next to it.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/786-5
00:51:31.084 --> 00:51:32.649
<v Amit Hiremath>you know, intelligence or.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/783-0
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:32.809
<v Dilip Kachot>Intelligence.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/784-0
00:51:33.369 --> 00:51:33.409
<v Aashish Sonawane>Oh.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/785-0
00:51:34.889 --> 00:51:35.009
<v Dilip Kachot>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/787-0

<v Dilip Kachot>OK.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/788-0
00:51:38.369 --> 00:51:39.529
<v Aashish Sonawane>That answers. Thanks.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/789-0
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:44.369
<v Amit Hiremath>Yeah, sure. Yeah. And and anyone else?</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/792-0
00:51:45.609 --> 00:51:49.837
<v Amit Hiremath>So think about it. You know,
this could be a great solution. I I mean,</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/792-1
00:51:49.837 --> 00:51:54.423
<v Amit Hiremath>I'll share the details with you in terms
of uptick. It's just uptick dot AI.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/792-2
00:51:54.423 --> 00:51:58.056
<v Amit Hiremath>I think you can go to the website and
find a lot of details.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/790-0
00:51:55.689 --> 00:51:56.809
<v Dilip Kachot>I just see it.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/792-3
00:51:58.056 --> 00:52:01.689
<v Amit Hiremath>Once we get the approval,
I'll do an announcement of course.</v>

ee560717-667c-4a08-8cbf-a197ebe10bc5/793-0
